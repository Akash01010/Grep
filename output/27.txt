607 covenant, which he made "between the Lord, and the king, and the people,

608 that they should be the Lord's people," 2 Kings xi. 17, 18, 20; for,

609 immediately after the making of his covenant, "all the people of the

735 compulsion, with an eye to secular profit or preferment, as many in

741 opposition and persecution we may meet with from the world for so doing,

756 by way of information, that seeing it is a people's duty, who have

767 of our covenants by people of all ranks; yet there appears so little

771 perpetual binding obligation; and that notwithstanding, as the Prophet

783 offended people, expressing some concernedness for this duty, with these

833 effectual influence to unite and cement the divided people of God: thus

869 betwixt God and a people, and their avouching of the same upon their

872 the great gospel blessings and mercies bestowed by God upon the Jews, to

875 owning themselves to be his people. So that the words may be taken up as

881 _my sirname now is an Israelite_. So sweetly should a shower of gospel

884 and covenanted people. Having taking up the sense of the words to this

888 people with very remarkable tokens of his gracious presence._ This

898 That a time of God's privileging his people with his gracious presence,

899 and with a shower of gospel grace, is a very inviting and alluring time;

900 wherein, as the Lord invites his people to their duty, by engaging their

906 the net of the gospel. 3d, That a time of the letting out of God's

908 resolutions, the people of God resolving to walk more accurately and

913 people, is a very uniting and healing time to them amongst themselves.

920 method with his people, or is not so good to them as formerly he hath

921 been: for whatever defects there are upon his people's part, there is

923 so to him; the change of his dispensations towards his people being from

924 the change of his people's deportment towards him.

936 the hearts of his people to embrace Christ, and so to make a public

969 operations, but either from carnal and external considerations, or at

1062 engaged to in the covenant, comprehends in it a zealous endeavor to

1064 of his institution, in opposition to all those who would corrupt it, or

1073 towards our nation, which comprehends a constant endeavor to advance and

1075 opposition to the courses that tend to take away the privilege of the

1085 know, and in some measure comprehend, the nature of the duties to be

1108 and death, which opposes the law of God; and partly from the strength of

1128 authority; and the opposition made thereunto by the laws of the land_;

1129 which, when it happens to be the case of a people designing to renew

1134 which are as so many props and pillars to support his people, and to

1137 Lord's_, and he is greatly concerned in it; and, therefore, his people

1139 men have. 2d, That _he looks not upon his people in such undertakings,

1143 workers of iniquity; _but he considers his people in their covenanting

1159 open their mouths wide, and he has promised to fill them. 5th, That the

1161 compensate whatever expense and pains a people may be at, in undertaking

1174 Lord's call to such a particular person, or people to undertake it, may

1175 be wanting; he came necessarily (which was the _second_ head proposed)

1180 considerations were proposed.

1195 and open breaches of these covenants, are a loud call to renew them. 2d,

1201 imposing oaths contrary and opposite to them; which brings double

1204 making unjust, sinful and hateful covenants, for opposing the growth and

1212 royal authority, a popular combination for advancing private ends and

1250 The _third_ thing proposed was to give some advices and directions for

1251 right managing the duty intended. The scope and substance whereof

1258 proposals of the covenant of grace; this personal and particular

1264 without a reformed heart is not sufficient: a good opinion and liking of

1280 of Christ. Both which interests ought to be in their due proportion

1324 to engage in the covenant, and yet to walk in a course opposite to it,

1334 opposition to this covenant, and such as being in a natural and

1348 unholy, and consequently, never an unhappy people; but it should be

1360 been able to oppose all our enemies; whereas the breach of it hath

1361 opened a door to all sorts of enemies to creep in amongst us, and hence

1362 is verified that which the Lord has threatened his people with for

1364 head, and his people the tail.

1405 people, ought to be publickly confessed for turning away these

1464 had no due sense, and that he should have proposed himself, as an

1465 example to the people; therefore, to discover the falsehood of such

1502 administration of the oath, causing the people to elevate their hands at

1531 life, you will not shape yourselves according to the company you fall

1532 into. As some have a religion for every company, so they have one for

1543 God of order_, and as he hath placed the stars in their proper orbs for

1566 covenanted duties, by drooping and discouragement under these crosses,

1602 broken, even it will I recompense upon his own head."

1607 preparation for the _holy communion_, putting the people in mind to be

1615 the opposers of our covenanted reformation, and to purchase the good

1616 opinion and commendation of men at the rate of losing the favor of God.

1617 The main end of relating some of the more material heads, scope and

1621 the same was cleared then to the people. And this brief relation,

1633 either be in danger to diminish the grace of God by complaining, or

1670 alike: The relation that the small and meaner sort of people have to God

1672 have, and the privileges of it, to be established as a people unto

1696 oblige all his posterity, virtually comprehended in him, Hos. xii. 4.

1714 of God, and extirpate the opposite thereof. _National vows_, devoting

1715 the then engaging, and succeeding generations to be the Lord's people,

1719 and people did covenant with each other, to perform their respective

1722 the king and parliament, and made the foundation of the people's compact

1765 and opposite to the commandment and covenant of the Lord, the supreme

1770 binding upon us the people of Scotland, and, therefore, may be renewed:

1780 us, who are but a poor insignificant handful of people, far from any

1783 covenant with God, and united in a sinful compact opposite thereto, so

1814 time, when the parliament and ministry is composed of a set of men that

1817 immoderately and unseasonably zealous people, as the deed of the whole

1820 effectually put a stop to the more general renovation thereof throughout

1832 cause them to think the Presbyterians to be a people of indiscreet and

1837 Jacobites and Episcopalians to represent them ill at court, and so

1848 calls to the work above mentioned will sufficiently, we hope,

1858 willing people to enter covenant with the Lord, even a perpetual

1868 needful to give any large account of it, nor will it fall so properly

1907 them, who spread and propagate or tolerate a false superstitious

1908 worship, ay and until they repent," And in relation to the opposing of

1910 excommunicate and debar all who are opposers of our covenants and

1919 is a sufficient cause (in the opinion of Protestant Divines) to debar

1934 of our poor and weak endeavours in this matter, which we hope will, at

1953 kingdoms have been blessed, since the first reformation from Popery;

1954 wherein he will see, how far different an opinion they have entertained

2053 baptism: His blasphemous opinion of transubstantiation, or real presence

2066 His justification by works, _opus operatum_, works of supererogation,

2069 hallowing of God's good creatures, with the superstitious opinion joined

2090 to become open enemies and persecutors of the same, under vain hope of

2091 the Pope's dispensation devised against the Word of God, to his greater

2546 time, by that small company of the Lord's people at Lanark, before their

2555 officers, our teachers, and our people. Albeit the Lord hath long and

2632 ministers and people, in a great measure complied with, submitted unto,

2650 And after the Lord was pleased in mercy to break the rod of oppression,

2651 and burst the bands of that horrid tyranny from off his people's necks,

2664 his church, sacrilegiously encroached upon by the magistrate. And people

2673 began to creep into the church, which corrupted people in that doctrine

2684 many of the people were left to be overcome by snares--"And so laid open

2685 to seek out other principles to justify their practices of compliance,

2693 against Popery, yet how have they been put to execution, when Papists

2694 are so rife and Popery prevalent?--the idolatrous mass being set up in

2700 suitable practice accompanying that belief; we have it to lament that

2702 of the doctrines of the gospel, and want a suitable practice and

2703 conversation becoming the gospel, cause, and cross of Christ. Many are

2708 of hazard, many ministers left off preaching, and the people hearing. We

2722 those of the Episcopal Communion in that part of Great Britain called

2733 people, complied with the tyrants and usurpers in the times of

2735 other taxations, intelligencers, and informers against the people of

2747 promoting and propagating of the Reformation and uniformity of religion,

2783 of Popery itself, under the usurper James, Duke of York; and since the

2791 stop to all endeavours of uniformity and union in the Lord's way, and to

2793 this nation hath entered into an _incorporating union_ with England in

2806 compassion to them as brethren, in not labouring to show them their sin

2822 Popery, Prelacy, Superstition, Heresy, Schism, Profaneness, and

2838 I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirits to pass out of the

2854 another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye

3005 Popish festival days--as Pasche, Yule, Fastings-even, &c, have been kept

3021 of enchantments and users of charms--yea, such as are in actual compact

3028 there have not been proper measures taken to suppress them, as this

3033 Edinburgh, being guarded by a company of the town guards. And as the

3045 and error, so schism, its inseparable companion, and necessary

3059 but many upon the left hand, have turned aside to compliance with

3154 unchastity and incentives to it. Much stealing, robbery and oppression,

3395 forementioned particulars so diametrically opposite to the Covenants,

3405 of being a proper way of defending their persons and authority, is

3432 of our sin, in complying with malignants in the greatness of our

3442 by joining once more with the people of these abominations, and taking

3628 suffered many of our brethren in many parts of the land to be oppressed

3629 of the common enemy, without compassion or relief. There hath been great

3638 oppressed people; concurring in arms against them at all the appearances
