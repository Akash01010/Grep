456 Europe came forth free and independent.  In it she first learned

459 to reconcile the philosopher to its horrors.  The hand of industry

470 rendered possible all that was accomplished, but it was far from being

494 who flocked to their standards, such as were not lured by the hope of plunder

500 were they indebted for their deliverance from popery.  Well was it also

503 no European sovereign was so absolute as to be able, in the pursuit

509 the only course open to a prudent prince is to connect the interests

602 came to be regarded by all Europe as the pillars of popery.  The hatred,

609 to their support, endangered, in no small degree, the freedom of Europe,

714 and of forbidding the open profession of its rival.  Subjects were to be free

736 If it had been opinions only that thus divided the minds of men,

738 But on these opinions depended riches, dignities, and rights;

741 in common, one now remained, while the other was compelled to leave

769 All the bishoprics and abbeys which had been secularized BEFORE the peace,

772 Every impropriator of an ecclesiastical foundation,

773 who held immediately of the Empire, whether elector, bishop, or abbot,

783 was strongly opposed by the Protestants; and though it was at last adopted

842 However little hope there might be of such a reconciliation,

853 when it was in their power, they even oppressed the Calvinists;

865 which should be first disarmed!  A sad and fearful prospect for

889 oppressed the adherents of the other; the ecclesiastical princes

893 under the wings of justice; and the complaints of spoliation

897 The peace which stipulated for complete religious toleration for

905 The Catholic subject of Protestant princes complained loudly of violations

906 of the religious peace -- the Lutherans still more loudly of the oppression

909 and inflamed the minds of the people.  Happy would it have been

915 but as if to complete the confusion, all concord was quickly broken.

916 The doctrines which had been propagated by Zuingli in Zurich,

918 among themselves, with little in unison save their common hatred to popery.

925 thrown away much of the advantage acquired by their rejection of popery.

926 Common complaints of the Romish hierarchy, and of ecclesiastical abuses,

1022 or the interests of party, hire them out to other powers.  With German troops,

1023 Philip the Second waged war against the Netherlands, and with German troops

1026 for their oppression.  The arrival of an ambassador, an extraordinary legate

1027 of the Pope, a conference of princes, every unusual incident, must,

1061 Maximilian left six sons, of whom the eldest, the Archduke Rodolph,

1066 Ferdinand the Second, incorporated with the rest of the family dominions.

1070 Rodolph the Second was not devoid of those virtues which might have gained him

1081 opened his ears to the evil counsels of the Jesuits, and the influence

1084 and alarmed by ridiculous prophecies, he withdrew, after the Spanish custom,

1090 The prospect of the rich inheritance of Spain was closed against him,

1100 under the formidable coalition which a great monarch of Europe had formed

1107 which stood in arms arrayed against each other:  between both, Rodolph,

1108 the despised opponent of the one, and the impotent protector of the other,

1120 its evil genius gave it a Rodolph for Emperor.  At a more peaceful period

1121 the Germanic Union would have managed its own interests, and Rodolph,

1126 could give weight to his resolves; and the hereditary dominions of Rodolph,

1131 to that, the supporters of Popery, but their countries were far from being so.

1132 The reformed opinions had penetrated even these, and favoured by

1154 and the people flocked in crowds to this new doctrine,

1167 to the turbulent nobility, when they fancied they had any reason to complain

1196 Ferdinand, Maximilian, and Rodolph, who were all sovereigns

1202 while the injured serf had to complain equally of his enemy and his protector.

1212 The downfall of popery in these lands would then have been inevitable.

1217 Maximilian's second son, Viceroy in Hungary, and Rodolph's presumptive heir,

1222 against the oppression of his own relative, Philip the Second.

1236 for the common good.  Matthias immediately opened a communication with

1240 to the lost provinces.  But Rodolph, as jealous as he had hitherto

1255 by his promises of toleration, loudly and openly espoused his cause,

1276 in an express treaty, (the Bohemian Compact); and though it was afterwards

1277 disavowed by the popes, they nevertheless continued to profit by it

1281 and they readily adopted an appellation which reminded them

1286 Among them both, the German and Swiss opinions on religion

1293 they had openly avowed their tenets.  After the example of the Germans,

1297 In this they were opposed by their Roman Catholic countrymen,

1300 As long as Maximilian lived, they enjoyed complete toleration, even under

1306 Accordingly, they all combined to oppose the imperial mandate in the Diet,

1309 on the Compact and the Bohemian Constitution; in which nothing appeared

1311 Since that time, how completely had affairs changed!

1312 What then formed but an inconsiderable opinion, had now become

1324 all his other subjects, he placed his last hopes on the Bohemians,

1328 and to convince the people that he was really still in existence,

1329 orders were given that all the windows should be opened in the streets

1340 between the two brothers was on the point of breaking out.  But Rodolph,

1359 beyond the old compact.  The Diet broke up without coming to a decision;

1365 almost under the very eyes of the Emperor.  The yielding compliance

1381 that people justified their rebellion.

1394 which subsequently rekindled the flames of war in Europe.

1411 to be forgiven, and Rodolph continued to nourish at heart

1414 into the hands of his enemy; and the prospect was not more consoling,

1419 to Ferdinand's brother, the Archduke Leopold, Bishop of Passau,

1422 of their crown, and their attachment to Leopold's person,

1423 seemed to favour this scheme, in which Rodolph consulted rather

1426 and Rodolph actually assembled an army in the bishopric of Passau.

1439 Matthias entered Prague amidst universal rejoicings, where Rodolph

1441 So hard a fate befell this Emperor; he was compelled, during his life,

1443 endeavouring to deprive him after his own death.  To complete his degradation,

1451 While Rodolph thus lost one hereditary dominion after another,

1491 that they might not be oppressed by the arbitrary appointment of the Emperor,

1510 Estates differing in religion, and which, therefore, properly belonged to

1572 reserving the ecclesiastical states from the general operation

1574 forfeited all right to the temporalities of his bishopric;

1583 from the opponents of their faith.  The example had already been set

1597 within the territories of Cologne, had already occasioned a violent opposition

1604 they proceeded forthwith to a new election, and chose the Bishop of Liege,

1610 What most made the Protestants indignant, was that the Pope

1613 of their spiritual domination, this prerogative of the Pope had been disputed;

1637 from the Netherlands supported with the utmost vigour.  The troops of Gebhard,

1639 to the enemy; by whom others were compelled to surrender.

1649 the same papal ban with the elector, had taken refuge within this bishopric,

1655 retired to Alsace-Saverne, where, under the protection of the bishop,

1660 upon the death of the bishop, to nominate a new Protestant bishop

1662 far from allowing this election, nominated the Bishop of Metz,

1668 of the troops of Lorraine, endeavoured to possess themselves

1672 his supreme authority to terminate the dispute; the ecclesiastical property

1682 had, in the usual way, become so completely predominant,

1687 the popular prejudices, and to arrange a public procession,

1688 preceded by the cross and banners flying; but he was soon compelled

1691 attempted to renew this procession, the citizens proceeded to open violence.

1695 of violence; and as the exasperated populace even threatened to assault

1738 the Religious Peace, and had little hope of succour from the Lutheran states.

1741 this country, an unfortunate toy in the hands of its rulers, had twice adopted

1766 opposed this union, because the Lutherans' dislike of the Reformed

1771 to their respective opinions.  Nothing then remained but to increase

1782 with the hope of obtaining a renewal of the Religious Peace,

1784 of the Protestant party was now added the late oppression of Donauwerth.

1798 should be open to his troops; and that, whatever conquests were made,

1799 should be divided among all the confederates, in proportion to

1809 The Electorate of Brandenburg adopted the alliance,

1818 dispirited, and singly, little feared, adopted a bolder language.

1829 with the distant prospect of a new war.  No wonder, then,

1841 Eight competitors laid claim to this territory, the indivisibility of which

1863 in vain did he send his own relation, the Archduke Leopold,

1864 Bishop of Passau and Strasburg, into the territory of Juliers, in order,

1871 of several European courts.  It was not so much the question,

1884 This monarch, the flower of whose life had been spent in opposing

1896 could extinguish in a bosom wherein flowed one drop of the blood

1898 the peace of Europe, and effected the most violent changes in the heart

1900 the workshops of artisans, to fill the land with enormous armies,

1902 It had imposed upon the princes of Europe the necessity

1905 which was thus lost to the prosperity of their inhabitants.

1906 For Europe there was no peace, for its states no welfare,

1907 for the people's happiness no security or permanence,

1916 for the endurance of that prosperity which he had gained for France,

1921 and a durable prosperity to his subjects, this dangerous power

1924 ardent, and well-founded as that of Hannibal against the people of Romulus,

1927 The other European powers had the same inducements to action as Henry,

1941 among the European powers, deserves the title of a chimera,

1947 whose co-operation was necessary, were to be persuaded to the work

1952 To the Pope and all the Italian republics no inducement could be more powerful

1953 than the hope of driving the Spaniards for ever from their peninsula;

1960 if it did not become more powerful.  Finally, upon condition of ridding Europe

1965 the tranquillity of Europe.

1968 a prompt and active part in the important events of the Evangelical Union,

1977 led by the king in person, was to meet the troops of the Union

1980 it was to march into Italy, (where Savoy, Venice, and the Pope were even now

1990 in its troubled waters the liberties of Europe, would then roll

1996 his appearance there, and an Austrian army, which the Bishop

2006 that they would not gratify, in every passing opportunity,

2008 they stooped upon the territories of the ecclesiastical princes,

2014 of their expedition, they announced, openly and intelligibly enough,

2015 the fate that awaited the property of the church.  So little had Henry IV.

2016 and the German princes understood each other in their plan of operations,

2028 so formidable and so insolent; and another union must now be opposed to them.

2030 The Bishop of Wurtzburg formed the plan of the Catholic union,

2033 the groundwork of the Union.  Bishops formed its principal members,

2038 the sole head of the League's military power, whereby their operations

2053 and the whole bishopric of Strasburg was in their power.

2062 the affairs of the Union -- at the united princes appropriating to themselves

2067 started to oppose it in the vigour of its strength.  Want of supplies

2071 they hastened to conclude a peace with their old enemy, the Archduke Leopold;

2072 and both parties agreed to withdraw their troops from Alsace,

2078 was now retorted by the League upon themselves and their troops.

2088 They had not calculated on so formidable an opponent; but they themselves

2102 that, with tears of blood, people prayed for the return of such an emperor.

2104 Rodolph never could be prevailed upon to choose a successor in the empire,

2106 but, beyond all hope, Matthias at once ascended it, and without opposition.

2107 The Roman Catholics gave him their voices, because they hoped the best

2109 because they hoped every thing from his weakness.  It is not difficult

2113 The moment of a new accession is always a day of hope; and the first Diet

2126 that a way was thus opened for the States to give laws to their sovereign.

2140 By a firm and resolute tone he hoped to check, at once,

2147 and, to avoid being compelled by force to do homage, their deputies

2149 immediately left the capital, and began to levy troops.

2153 seriously to work to accomplish their object by force of arms.

2156 Matthias had not hesitated to comply.  For Hungary was an elective monarchy,

2161 the scorn of Roman Catholic Europe, the enmity of Spain and Rome,

2163 Romish council, among which the Bishop of Vienna, Melchio Kiesel,

2168 But by ill luck this difficulty occurred at a time when the Emperor Rodolph

2181 The example of Rodolph should be a warning to Matthias.  He should take care

2184 as mediators for the Emperor's advantage, finally adopted the cause

2187 on the part of the Emperor, he was at length compelled to make

2207 Complaints of the judicial usurpations of the Aulic Council,

2208 and of the oppression of the Protestants, accompanied this demand,

2223 at the idea, however remote, of an open war with the Protestants.

2239 the prospect of so powerful a support gave him greater boldness

2240 to oppose the Protestants.  Their demands were rejected, and the Diet broke up

2257 between the two houses was at an end.  The Prince of Neuburg embraced popery.

2261 the Spanish troops from the Netherlands were marched into the Palatinate.

2263 called the Flemings to his assistance, whom he sought to propitiate

2277 The tranquillity which Rodolph II.'s `Letter of Majesty' had established

2285 hereditary dominions, announced himself as an inexorable zealot for popery,

2292 were incautious enough to speak somewhat loudly of their hopes,

2297 furnished the discontent of the people with enterprising leaders.

2299 Henry Matthias, Count Thurn, not a native of Bohemia, but proprietor

2301 and an enthusiastic attachment to his newly adopted country,

2302 gained the entire confidence of the Utraquists, which opened him the way to

2310 to hold in leading-strings such a people as the Bohemians then were.

2312 under Rodolph's administration; and the Letter of Majesty which the States

2322 thereby opening his eyes to the importance of the other which remained,

2325 by a desire of revenge; and the opportunity of gratifying it

2328 In the Royal Letter which the Bohemians had extorted from Rodolph II.,

2337 churches and schools, and openly to celebrate their Protestant worship;

2341 in its fullest extent; the secular indeed without opposition;

2347 how far obedience might be compulsory; in the latter, the interpretation

2350 of Ferdinand secured to the subjects of German bishops,

2352 because they looked upon the ecclesiastical property as part of

2354 subject to the Archbishop of Prague; and in Braunau, which belonged to

2356 and completed notwithstanding the opposition of their superiors,

2367 showed himself not a little busy in inflaming the minds of the people.

2389 Among the imperial delegates, the chief objects of the popular hatred,

2392 Both had long before evinced pretty openly their hostile feelings

2401 and of endeavouring to drive them to popery by a denial of the rites

2402 of baptism, marriage, and burial.  Against two characters so unpopular

2411 Sternberg received them with composure, Martinitz and Slawata with defiance.

2439 of every previous oppression, were banished the kingdom,

2448 sought out his king and master in the very bosom of his people,

2452 drove him to join them.  But he could not hope to confine such a war

2456 into a formidable republic.  What could he oppose to such an enemy,

2466 which would justify in the eyes of all Europe the severest measures

2482 the wisdom of a prompt obedience in future."  Were the Bohemian Protestants

2493 and promised to send troops from Italy and the Netherlands.

2504 of the insurrection contrived to hide from the people

2507 and terrified the deluded populace with threatened horrors

2515 which would at all times keep open for the imperial troops

2516 an entrance into the kingdom.  With prompt determination

2517 he appeared before Budweiss and Krummau, in the hope of terrifying them

2525 every position that was the least tenable, must be opened by the sword,

2527 of their troops, chiefly consisting of Hungarians and Walloons,

2529 But even now that his troops had penetrated into Bohemia,

2531 for an amicable adjustment.  But the new prospects which opened upon them,

2540 and the cause of this people was represented as of solemn concern

2543 and a fortunate accident now enabled them, beyond their hopes, to fulfil them.

2550 and under the banner of the Archduke Leopold, against the Protestant religion

2562 Nothing could be more welcome to these troops than the prospect of aiding

2575 of his military operations, a negotiation was entered into with the Emperor,

2578 in these proposals, the Emperor was removed from the scene by death.

2591 with the closing administration, was already opening his own.

2618 and a prompt instrument of the church, he left Bavaria,

2651 to bequeath to him the succession, met with little or no opposition

2660 they were alarmed by a secret family compact with Spain, by which,

2666 who had taken refuge there, bringing with them into their adopted country

2682 entirely unfettered.  All hopes of their peaceful submission were at an end,

2691 as it had been under Rodolph, and the Estates refused to do homage.

2695 and, to complete his perplexities, the Protestants also,

2707 made overtures to the Bohemian rebels, all his proposals for peace

2718 invited into the country to oppress the Bohemians.  Let them be sought out,

2725 A handful of soldiers was all he could oppose to the enraged multitude;

2730 to levy troops against him.  Already, in imagination, the Protestant populace

2734 to engulf his hopes and even himself.  The Bohemian bullets were already

2759 just at the same time from Bohemia made his deliverance complete.

2771 it would give him a hope of support from the Empire.  But the same cabal

2772 which opposed him in his hereditary dominions, laboured also to counteract him

2781 should annihilate all the hopes of Ferdinand, and incapacitate him

2782 from any competition for this dignity.  The members of the Union

2790 But in spite of all opposing influences, the day of election was fixed,

2794 were for him, Saxony was favourable to him, Brandenburg made no opposition,

2806 of the late Emperor, had furnished troops to oppress them,

2809 by a secret compact, to Spain:  they therefore declared

2820 Among all the princes who were competitors for this dignity,

2824 and the attachment of the people, seemed to be justified by so many

2841 he sought to confirm himself in his purpose by the opinions of others;

2842 but these opinions had no weight with him when they ran counter to

2844 all his brother electors, all who compared the magnitude of the design

2852 a free people throws itself into his arms.  Confiding in his courage,

2854 To him, as to its born champion, an oppressed religion looks for shelter

2863 or such hopes to animate and inflame his resolution?

2866 the danger of the undertaking, and the comparative worthlessness of the prize.

2870 opened to the ambition and avarice of his Palatine servants an unlimited field

2877 The dreams of astrology filled his mind with visionary hopes;

2879 to complete the seduction.  "Had you," demanded the Electress,

2886 with unexampled pomp at Prague, for the nation displayed all its riches

2895 His principal hopes rested on Prince Bethlen Gabor of Transylvania.

2899 this opportunity of aggrandizing himself at the expense of Austria,

2908 Before him went terror, and devastation behind; all opposition yielded,

2920 and the inclement weather, finally compelled the Bohemians

2950 which assured to the Duke of Bavaria compensation for all the expenses

2952 the command of the troops of the League, which were ordered to march

2958 to take an open part in the Bohemian war, they might reckon

2960 Without some open step taken by the Roman Catholics against the Union,

2971 and render inevitable a war in which they hoped to be the conquerors.

2972 Maximilian, firmly attached to the opposite party from so many

2976 were opened with the Spanish court.  All the difficulties with which

2987 propagating a rumour that the preparations of the League had for their object

3001 the open ally of the Porte, he gave offence to weak minds;

3006 New and oppressive imposts alienated the affections of all his subjects.

3007 The disappointed hopes of the Bohemian nobles cooled their zeal;

3011 by a wise economy, he squandered his revenues by a needless theatrical pomp,

3016 But greatly as men had erred in their opinion of him,

3029 One friend after another withdrew; one hope vanished after another --

3033 the Emperor and the League did the same.  The troops of the latter

3052 before the Huguenots could copy their dangerous example.  In order therefore

3053 to facilitate the Emperor's operations against the Bohemians,

3060 and the fear of being pressed at once by the troops of the League,

3070 In Lower Austria, the duke formed a junction with the troops

3073 entered Bohemia.  All the Bohemian troops, which were dispersed

3077 voluntarily opened their gates; nothing in short interrupted

3083 The wretched condition in which he hoped to surprise the insurgents,

3100 bitter complaints from the peasantry.  It was in vain that Frederick made

3101 his appearance in the camp, in the hope of reviving the courage

3114 composing the whole of Frederick's artillery, were taken by the enemy;

3134 The light troops of Mansfeld were still in Pilsen, and were not engaged

3139 but all these hopes disappeared before the immediate alarm.

3160 composed of native Bohemians and Austrians.  Of these, twenty-seven,

3161 and of the common people an immense number, expired on the scaffold.

3165 and their names affixed to the gallows.  The property also of the rebels

3168 but more intolerable was the oppression which extended to the whole kingdom,

3204 The resolution which Ferdinand now adopted, gave to the war a new direction,

3207 and afterwards to Europe.  It is, therefore, necessary to take

3209 and the rest of Europe.

3213 neither party could hope to maintain itself against the encroachments

3218 a more compact and populous line of territories, valiant princes,

3223 opened their treasures to the Protestants, while the states of the North

3225 prompt assistance.  Brandenburg, Saxony, and the Palatinate,

3226 opposed three Protestant to three Ecclesiastical votes

3242 he might adopt, the fate of the contending parties seemed to depend;

3258 by his suspicious friendship more seriously than the open enmity

3259 of its avowed opponents.  But it would have been well if his accusers had

3267 If an excessive reliance on the Emperor, and the hope of enlarging

3319 who, however, enjoyed most of the prosperity accruing from them,

3327 anxiously avoided a contest with such an opponent, and crouched murmuring

3338 the multitudes whom the prosperity of their territories allured,

3341 they could not openly oppose in the field.  All of them,

3354 the markets of Europe; the bankers of Antwerp, Venice, and Genoa,

3356 For the sake of India, Spain had been depopulated, while the treasures

3371 the dependence by which the emperors purchased it.  The fate of Europe

3380 to the eastward, and all Europe was at its mercy, if it could succeed in

3387 The Pope himself was in the most dangerous situation;

3393 by the Italian States.  The double character which pertained to the Popes

3399 and most formidable opponents.  If, in the one capacity, their dearest wish

3404 predominated in the mind of the Pope.  But the policy of Rome was,

3408 it becomes intelligible how the Pope should first combine with Austria

3412 and of the liberties of Germany, if the Bishop of Rome and the Prince of Rome

3416 in the political balance of Europe.  A turbulent minority had destroyed

3421 they were compelled to resign to other hands the helm of European affairs.

3426 now seized the opportunity to take up arms, and, under the command

3436 the son of Henry the Fourth was now compelled to be an inactive spectator

3445 republic of Holland was completing the fabric of its greatness.

3447 enkindled by the House of Orange, had converted this mercantile people

3452 as both were opposed to the same enemy, and the liberty of Germany

3456 could not be expected to withdraw its troops from the necessary work

3461 under the weak James, that influence in the affairs of Europe

3466 Her successor was no less devoid of capacity to comprehend,

3474 he reminded the people of theirs; and by a useless profusion,

3479 and his own complacent vanity rendered him an easy dupe of Spanish artifice.

3483 To divert his attention from the German war, he was amused with the proposal

3501 and prudent alliances, had combined to give her prosperity at home

3504 this newly-organized state into the field of European politics.

3506 was filled up by Gustavus Adolphus, his still greater grandson.

3510 and this separation was the epoch of their prosperity.

3511 Injurious as this compulsory union had proved to both kingdoms,

3518 nor the Swedes banish the remembrance of Danish oppression.

3527 excluded the adherents of popery from all offices of the state,

3530 and second successor of Gustavus had relapsed into popery,

3535 in an open civil war between the uncle and nephew,

3536 and between the King and the people.  Duke Charles,

3546 (who reigned under the name of Charles IX.) was Gustavus Adolphus, whom,

3554 Gustavus Adolphus had not completed his seventeenth year,

3570 over the father of that hero.  Gustavus Adolphus hastened to put an end

3584 in this infatuated prince the foolish hope of regaining his lost throne.

3588 Though constantly victorious, Gustavus Adolphus was always the first

3604 The vehemence with which he nourished his chimerical hopes blinded him to

3606 the Swedish hero employed, in order to overturn, without opposition,

3615 After this necessary digression on the existing circumstances of Europe,

3647 With this object, the oppression of the Protestants was inseparably connected.

3648 More favourable circumstances for its accomplishment could not offer

3673 but it was hopeless for a power which was far from a match

3674 even for the Spanish troops in the Lower Palatinate, to contend against

3693 in the Upper Palatinate, and enlisted the disbanded troops of the Union.

3697 the neighbouring bishops trembled for their rich possessions, which offered

3699 who now entered the Upper Palatinate, Mansfeld was compelled to retire.

3702 and there wreaked upon the bishoprics of the Rhine the severities he had

3710 The Spanish general, Corduba, who commanded these troops after the recall

3713 of this province, he hastened across the Rhine to secure for his needy troops

3714 shelter and subsistence in Alsace.  The open countries on which this

3721 was not irretrievably lost.  New prospects began to open,

3722 and misfortune raised up friends who had been silent during his prosperity.

3727 Late enough, he at last opened his treasures, and hastened to afford supplies

3728 of money and troops, first to the Union, which at that time was defending

3755 the Upper Palatinate having been long conquered.  A ray of hope

3762 in the hope of eluding, by this precaution, the Emperor's revenge,

3767 for his own safety, and he hastily summoned the Spanish troops, under Corduba,

3794 to plunder the bishoprics upon the Upper Rhine.  Driven from thence,

3798 With the loss of half his army he reached the opposite bank, where he

3799 quickly collected his shattered troops, and formed a junction with Mansfeld.

3806 of all hope of seeing the Palatine restored to his dominion.

3808 into a negotiation, hoping thereby to cool their ardour in the field,

3823 both marched into Lorraine, where the excesses of their troops

3829 where their appearance compelled the Spanish general forthwith

3830 to raise the siege of Bergen-op-Zoom.  But even Holland was soon weary

3832 to get rid of their unwelcome assistance.  Mansfeld allowed his troops

3843 driven from the field, and the Palatinate overrun by the executive troops

3852 Ferdinand believed that a sincere reconciliation was not to be hoped for.

3853 The violent course he had once begun, must be completed successfully,

3855 Frederick could never hope to regain his dominions;

3861 of the Palatine family, they had as much to hope from

3878 two religions equally detested, the Calvinistic and the Popish,

3881 of opposite duties, it was natural that private hate and private gain

3888 from Bohemia, was the cause of this change of opinion; and, in the eyes

3904 This violent step at last opened the eyes of the King of England;

3917 Spain from the Valtelline, and to compel Austria to reinstate Frederick;

3923 against the Emperor.  Great as were the hopes which had been formed from

3948 without a power to oppose them, should they venture to attack

3967 to arm itself.  Extraordinary contributions were levied, troops collected,

3974 The twofold interests of religion and policy urged them to put a stop

3977 and by considerations equally powerful, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden

3981 and of opposing the formidable power of Austria.  Each offered to raise

3990 Gustavus Adolphus, for his own security, had demanded the cession

3992 to afford, in case of need, a place of refuge for his troops.

3996 Eager to get the start of his competitor, the King of Denmark hastened

4000 with him.  Encouraged by the hope of assistance from England,

4009 than defensive operations, and to contemplate nothing less

4010 than the complete restoration of the Elector Palatine,

4020 in which he quartered his troops.  The king conducted his operations

4024 Aware of his opponent's superiority, he avoided a decisive action

4027 With the exception of the troops from the Spanish Netherlands,

4042 nothing but general odium, while they appropriated to themselves

4048 more welcome to the Emperor than the proposal with which

4059 of the Bohemian insurgents was their reward.  Possessed of immense property,

4073 the prospect of rapid promotion, and the hope of plunder,

4081 to unite his army with the troops of the League, and in conjunction

4085 to dim the lustre of his own.  His plan of operations was

4088 he was obliged to march his troops into fertile countries

4120 into Westphalia, to seize the bishoprics of Munster and Osnaburg.

4122 but the operations of Duke Christian, who threatened the territories

4125 In order to keep open his communication with these provinces,

4133 for a long siege, the latter attempted to open a new passage

4144 and the general of the League obtained a complete victory.

4147 were killed in the field of battle; and several companies of foot,

4158 and one after another his scattered troops were either defeated or dispersed.

4177 to break it, with the first ray of hope, he directed Mansfeld in the mean time

4180 Cut off from Germany, and unable to support the weak remnant of his troops

4187 died the faithful companion of his fortunes, Christian, Duke of Brunswick --

4191 The King of Denmark, with his whole army, was unable to cope with Tilly alone;

4208 and compelled him to recognise, as legitimate, Maximilian's title

4210 by imperial troops; and both dukes, as adherents of the King of Denmark,

4221 had subsisted their troops by contributions levied indiscriminately

4223 all the inconvenience and insecurity which accompany robbery.

4226 to watch their opportunity with anxiety; and to abandon

4235 had hitherto adopted at their own risk, and with only an untrained multitude?

4244 its oppressions, prevented any dangerous union among the states;

4253 and the general who exceeded his power, and openly abused the authority

4261 and inferior commands, the regal pomp of the commander-in-chief,

4276 of the people, and the complaints of princes?  His army adored him,

4290 and the Emperor, and to elevate the power of the latter above all competition.

4308 but an ordinary recompense would not satisfy Wallenstein's ambition.

4312 oppose his elevation.  The powerful support which Wallenstein had purchased

4323 of their own country, and to compel them to a peace which might

4326 could the Emperor place himself between them, and encompass Germany,

4347 his cunningly demanded permission to march his troops through the town,

4348 Wallenstein, therefore, now proposed to besiege it.

4353 In a treaty concluded at Copenhagen in 1628, they bound themselves

4354 to assist Stralsund with their combined force, and to oppose in common

4368 open to the sea, continued to be supplied with provisions and reinforcements;

4374 of the apparent submission and acceptable propositions of the inhabitants,

4379 any further troops to their support, Stralsund, with Christian's consent,

4386 of a close alliance between Gustavus Adolphus and Stralsund,

4392 the conquerors.  The want of ships not only stopped the pursuit of the king,

4398 the Danish king, they might hope to overpower the insulated force of Sweden.

4402 inclined the Emperor to peace, which his general, from opposite motives,

4411 By the treaty of Copenhagen, Christian IV. had expressly engaged

4413 of Sweden.  Notwithstanding, Wallenstein's proposition was readily received

4464 that all the archbishoprics, bishoprics, mediate and immediate,

4486 that the restoration of the Roman Catholic bishops would increase

4489 made the Emperor apprehensive of a formidable opposition;

4500 some bolder experiments in that quarter.  In the bishoprics

4502 to elect bishops of their own religion.  Both bishoprics,

4504 by the troops of Wallenstein.  It happened, moreover, that by the death

4506 as was also the Archbishopric of Magdeburg by the deposition

4509 to a Roman Catholic bishop, and a prince of his own house.

4511 a son of the Elector of Saxony as archbishop.  But the pope,

4513 conferred the Archbishopric of Magdeburg also on the Austrian prince.

4543 He further decided, "That, by the religious peace, Catholic proprietors

4551 This sentence applied to no less than two archbishoprics

4552 and twelve bishoprics, besides innumerable abbacies.

4561 the city was again placed under the government of its bishop, and six

4563 in like manner, compelled to surrender his abbacies.  These severe measures,

4567 The hope of attaining their end by gentle measures,

4576 was debated.  The complaints of the Roman Catholics

4586 completely undermined.  Another had now stepped in to reap the fruits

4623 He himself appeared in Ratisbon, with a pomp which threw his master

4624 into the shade, and increased the hatred of his opponents.

4648 was peculiarly alarming, and who welcomed this prospect of making,

4650 In spite of all the exertions of Pope Urban VIII. to avert a war

4670 the desired opportunity of entangling the Emperor in dangerous intrigues,

4674 in Father Joseph, a Capuchin friar, who accompanied the ambassadors

4678 would lose its principal strength; many armies could not compensate

4681 the absolute master of his operations, was arming against the Emperor,

4683 by ability and military experience, was able to cope with the French king.

4704 a complete neutrality between the Emperor and his enemies; while,

4744 were ripe, or his preparations complete, for the bold measures

4748 for revenge; and in this hope he was encouraged by the predictions

4751 brilliant career was not yet ended; and that bright and glorious prospects

4753 to foretell that an enemy, Gustavus Adolphus, would ere long

4770 to private life.  In his retreat, he surrounded himself with a regal pomp,

4780 his baggage and suite accompanied him in a hundred wagons,

4782 attended by fifty led horses.  The pomp of his liveries,

4810 to reckon among his certain possessions those which he contemplated with hope.

4812 After Wallenstein's dismissal, and the invasion of Gustavus Adolphus,

4818 At last, in order to avoid offence to either of the competitors,

4830 the Emperor's progress, Gustavus Adolphus was the only prince in Europe

4831 from whom oppressed liberty could look for protection -- the only one who,

4838 Since that time, Wallenstein and the Emperor had adopted measures

4840 Imperial troops had been despatched to the aid of the Polish king, Sigismund,

4841 to defend Prussia against the Swedes.  When the king complained to Wallenstein

4859 who was flattered by the glory he hoped to gain as Protector of the Oppressed,

4865 This great statesman, who guided the helm of Europe, while in France

4869 But circumstances opposed considerable obstacles to the execution

4873 the enemies of that church in an open attack on a power which had the address

4877 by which he endeavoured to gain the hand of others to accomplish

4880 he had recourse to Gustavus Adolphus, the hero of his age.

4884 where Gustavus Adolphus was conducting the war against Sigismund,

4887 and the French minister succeeded at last in opening the eyes of Sigismund

4893 and considerable subsidies.  But Gustavus Adolphus was justly apprehensive

4903 which opposed his undertaking, but he knew also the means by which,

4904 as he hoped, they might be conquered.  His army, though not numerous,

4912 and openly declare for the Swedes.  Even the Roman Catholic states

4913 would welcome an antagonist to the Emperor, whose opposition might control

4917 augment his troops, and open resources for the maintenance of the campaign.

4918 If the greater part of the German states were impoverished by oppression,

4927 Great Britain, on the other hand, gave the King of Sweden hope

4938 a more effective system of warfare, which was adopted as a model

4947 a practice which frequently decided the victory.  Europe first learned

4981 to compete with those of a despotic sovereign, who held all Germany

4990 is open to us, we shall both command the Baltic, and secure a retreat

5010 to advance him money, and to accept Swedish copper in return.

5015 the regiments increased to their full complement, new ones raised,

5019 across the Baltic.  A greater force Gustavus Adolphus was unwilling

5026 in Prussia, to protect that province against Poland.  Some regular troops,

5048 sufficient composure to deliver his farewell address to the States.

5056 The oppressed states of Germany call loudly for aid, which, by God's help,

5068 of my people.  You, too, my brave nobles, I commend to the divine protection.

5073 over the minds of my people.  On you, deputies of the burgesses,

5075 be rewarded by a prosperous harvest; your stores plenteously filled,

5077 For the prosperity of all my subjects, absent and present,

5081 The embarkation of the troops took place at Elfsknaben,

5093 Gustavus Adolphus was the first who landed.  In the presence of his suite,

5095 for the safe arrival of his fleet and his army.  He landed his troops

5105 the Emperor's vengeance prevented him from declaring openly for the Swedes.

5106 Gustavus Adolphus, who was encamped under the walls of the town,

5118 your intention to stop my progress?  The case is pressing:  decide at once,

5119 and do not compel me to have recourse to more violent measures."

5126 The gates of Stettin were opened to the king; the Swedish troops entered;

5129 the command of the Oder, and a magazine for his troops.  To prevent a charge

5136 As Ferdinand was already the aggressor in Prussia, Gustavus Adolphus

5138 without any declaration of war.  To the other European powers,

5141 in Pomerania, while he saw his army daily increasing.  The troops which had

5150 of Europe, and who owed his past successes, as they imagined, entirely to

5151 the incapacity of a weak opponent.  The depreciatory representation

5155 Even the rapid progress of Gustavus Adolphus in Pomerania,

5160 disregarded his representations; and, influenced by an abject complaisance

5165 Notwithstanding this contempt, the Emperor thought it proper

5168 But their instructions showed how little he was in earnest in these proposals,

5170 He hoped by this means to throw on the king of Sweden the odium of being

5181 permitted his troops, upon his retreat, to exercise every barbarity

5188 the opposite conduct of the Swedes, and to win all hearts

5190 no private property was injured on his march.  The Swedes consequently

5191 were received with open arms both in town and country,

5205 Torquato, too deficient in troops and money to act upon the offensive

5206 against the king, hoped by this plan of operations to give time for Tilly

5208 that general, to attack the Swedes.  Seizing the opportunity

5214 as to his military talents.  The imperial troops in Pomerania

5223 to allow his troops the repose of winter quarters, but he had to do

5230 as well as in summer, and not disposed to oppress the unfortunate peasantry.

5231 The Imperialists may act as they think proper, but they need not expect

5245 By seizing the passes of Riebnitz and Damgarden, Gustavus had opened

5255 driven to despair by the Emperor's inflexibility, they openly espoused

5256 the side of Sweden, and raising troops, gave the command of them

5259 to the Imperial General Pappenheim, who was despatched to oppose him.

5261 he was compelled to surrender with all his troops.  Thus ended the attempt

5263 and it was reserved for the victorious arm of Gustavus Adolphus

5271 which want of money compelled them to wink at, and of authority

5272 over their troops, excited the disgust even of the imperial generals;

5287 and only the Elector's refusal to open to him the fortress of Custrin

5289 Frankfort on the Oder.  He therefore returned to complete the conquest

5296 to meet an opponent worthy of his fame.  Descended of a noble family in Liege,

5298 which was then the great school for generals.  He soon found an opportunity

5299 of distinguishing himself under Rodolph II. in Hungary, where he rapidly rose

5305 of the troops of the League; and, after Wallenstein's dismissal,

5310 co-operated, with the natural ferocity of his character, to make him

5319 who was now to be opposed to the hero of the north.

5325 His army, composed of Swedes, Germans, Livonians, Finlanders,

5333 With all expedition, he collected the imperial troops which were dispersed

5345 near Schwedt defied attack, Tilly abandoned his offensive plan of operations,

5348 The capture of Demmin opened to the king a free passage into Mecklenburg;

5353 a garrison of 8,000 men, mostly composed of those ferocious bands

5365 of his troops, Gustavus Adolphus was under the necessity of giving up the town

5372 Compelled by necessity, he continued the violent course which he had begun

5375 by measures still more arbitrary.  But in so complicated a body

5381 The steps openly taken by the Emperor against the Lutheran church,

5385 from the archbishopric of Magdeburg; and field-marshal Arnheim,

5390 by detaching Saxony from the Austrian interests.  Gustavus Adolphus,

5420 counts, estates of the empire, and Protestant bishops were present,

5422 the Saxon Court, Dr. Hoe von Hohenegg, opened with a vehement discourse

5427 of Gustavus Adolphus, the assembled princes asserted their rights,

5428 and after a session of two months broke up, with adopting a resolution

5431 of the Edict of Restitution, the withdrawal of his troops from

5446 Richelieu yielded the second, and Gustavus Adolphus the first point,

5467 as he now was, by the greatest power in Europe, the German states

5473 for their religion.  And thus, while Gustavus Adolphus protected

5484 should deem it too bold a step as yet to declare openly in his favour.

5485 Several princes gave him hopes of his proposals being accepted

5486 on the first favourable opportunity; but the Saxon Elector,

5496 strongly prohibiting them from enlisting troops.  They retorted

5500 Meantime, the imperial generals, deficient both in troops and money,

5512 The rich archbishopric, of which Magdeburg was the capital,

5520 in order to confer the archbishopric on his son Leopold.

5521 The Elector of Saxony complained ineffectually to the imperial court;

5524 and excited by chimerical hopes, he thought himself able to surmount

5525 all the obstacles which the vote of the chapter, the competition of

5526 two powerful rivals, and the Edict of Restitution opposed to his restoration.

5529 not without hopes of effectual protection, but with the advice

5535 which both town and country had suffered from the imperial troops,

5538 was at hand, and that Gustavus Adolphus offered them his alliance

5544 Their territory had been given up to the fury of his troops,

5554 The Administrator immediately collected troops and commenced hostilities,

5555 before Gustavus Adolphus was near enough to co-operate with him.  He defeated

5558 to retreat hastily, and not without loss, to Magdeburg.  Gustavus Adolphus,

5560 an experienced officer, to direct the Administrator's military operations,

5568 Driving the troops of the Administrator from their entrenchments,

5571 to comply with the Edict of Restitution, to submit to the Emperor's orders,

5577 and the jealousy of the officers, who conducted the operations in his absence,

5583 destroyed the bridge over the Elbe.  As his troops were barely sufficient

5587 and attacked the town from the opposite side.

5594 by their disunion threw the town into confusion.  The poor complained

5597 broke out at last in an open mutiny; indifference succeeded to zeal;

5601 their undertaking, and the magnitude of the power to which they were opposed.

5608 Their hopes of succour were apparently well founded.  They knew that

5610 of Gustavus Adolphus.  Both were alike interested in the preservation

5620 with uneasiness, but raised the hopes of the garrison.  A second trumpeter

5632 adopted against them.  But the ammunition of the besieged was nearly expended,

5635 Magdeburg would be either relieved, or taken.  The hopes of the besieged

5637 in which the Swedish banners were expected to appear.  Gustavus Adolphus

5638 was near enough to reach Magdeburg within three days; security grew with hope,

5640 of the Imperialists was suddenly stopped, and the cannon withdrawn from

5648 Tilly had abandoned the hope of taking the town, before the arrival

5649 of the Swedes, by the means which he had hitherto adopted;

5663 where the attempt was favoured by a sloping rampart, and a dry ditch

5666 found little difficulty in mounting the wall at the head of his troops.

5678 Still some hope of repulsing the besiegers remained; but the governor

5679 being killed, their efforts were without plan and co-operation, and at last

5686 and completed their rout.  Amidst the general tumult, a brave captain,

5689 and with him expired the hopes of Magdeburg.  Before noon,

5692 Two gates were now opened by the storming party for the main body,

5702 The prayers of innocence excited some compassion in the hearts of the Germans,

5704 the savage cruelty commenced, when the other gates were thrown open,

5719 that he had it in his power to stop the carnage.  "Return in an hour,"

5728 the crash of falling ruins, and streams of blood.  The atmosphere glowed;

5730 in their camp.  In less than twelve hours, this strong, populous,

5736 had saved 400 of the richest citizens, in the hope of extorting from them

5756 put a stop to the plunder, and saved the few who had hitherto contrived

5757 to escape.  About a thousand people were taken out of the cathedral,

5766 and prosperity of the city razed, or the fury of its ravagers.

5771 they complained against the king of Sweden, who, with so strong a force,

5774 and lest he should lose irretrievably the good will of the people,

5787 had already opened the fortress of Custrin to the flying Imperialists,

5789 in his attack upon Tilly, the Elector might again open his fortresses

5808 the Swedish troops approached Berlin, and the king took up his residence

5823 an exhausted country, and filled with the enemy's troops, who might

5830 a free passage and liberty for purchasing provisions for his troops.

5840 in the imperious tone he adopted towards the Protestant states.

5844 As the executor of this imperial mandate, Tilly immediately ordered troops

5845 to march against the Bishop of Bremen, who was a member of the Confederacy,

5846 and had himself enlisted soldiers.  The terrified bishop

5851 The duke was compelled to submit to the Edict of Restitution,

5853 of 100,000 dollars, for the maintenance of the imperial troops.

5861 in favour of Gustavus Adolphus.  Injurious as the immediate consequences

5883 which a prince of the Empire was compelled to submit to from a servant

6217 gloomy forebodings clouded his ever-open brow; the shade of Magdeburg

6244 attacked with his victorious troops the left wing of the Swedes.

6252 of their attack, when Gustavus Adolphus appeared to terminate the contest.

6254 having no longer any enemy to oppose, could now turn their arms

6267 and gained a small thicket, where they opposed a new front to the Swedes,

6272 Amid the dead and the wounded, Gustavus Adolphus threw himself on his knees;

6285 was so complete, that Tilly, on his retreat to Halle and Halberstadt,

6300 Even his last consolation, the hope of revenge, was denied to him,

6305 abandoning these heights, and his allowing the enemy, without opposition,

6324 repaired to meet the king, and to concert their future plan of operations.

6331 into the enemy's country, which, open and defenceless as far as Vienna,

6336 that now remained was to assign its respective parts.  Gustavus Adolphus,

6340 of their defenders, while the oppressed Protestants in these countries

6342 Vienna, on the first terror of surprise, would at once open its gates.

6347 of his dominions.  This bold plan of operations was flattering to a conqueror,

6348 and success perhaps might have justified it.  But Gustavus Adolphus,

6358 it would not do to oppose an Arnheim, of whose military skill

6366 Could he hope to reduce the Emperor more than had been done,

6379 Gustavus Adolphus hoped, by his presence, to unite the discontented princes,

6404 of Gustavus Adolphus, as well as in the opinion which both friends and foes

6408 the most experienced troops in Europe.  From this moment he felt

6410 the parent of great actions.  In all his subsequent operations

6451 Nothing could stop his progress, or check his pretensions,

6458 for a time repressed, now revived; and scarcely had Gustavus Adolphus merited,

6466 openly to declare their sentiments and join his party.

6478 his popular deportment, some brilliant acts of justice, and his respect

6481 and the troops of Lorraine, powerfully contributed to set his own conduct

6484 If Gustavus Adolphus owed his success chiefly to his own genius,

6492 while his opponents, the princes of the League, divided among themselves,

6495 while their generals were deficient in authority, their troops in obedience,

6496 the operations of their scattered armies without concert;

6498 these several functions were united in Gustavus Adolphus,

6503 which was altogether wanting to their opponents.  No wonder, then,

6506 Gustavus Adolphus was irresistible.

6517 and Bamberg, and three fugitive bishops, at a distance from their sees,

6525 those of the Lecke and the Donau were crowded with Swedish troops.

6533 While Gustavus Adolphus was extending his conquests in the south,

6547 The offended Pope sported, in pompous processions and idle anathemas,

6565 from whom he could hope for the revival of his former splendour,

6577 in the hands of Gustavus Adolphus, was to be the object of another

6582 The eyes of Europe turned to the scene in curiosity and alarm,

6599 no loss of a single man is irreparable.  As the helm of war dropped

6605 I may now be permitted to take a cursory retrospect of Gustavus Adolphus

6612 As soon as the plan of operations had been concerted at Halle,

6615 and preparations made for the recovery of the bishopric of Magdeburg,

6620 must be disputed sword in hand.  On the Rhine he was opposed by the Spaniards,

6631 If he was to be opposed by the fanaticism of the Roman Catholics,

6634 and their hatred to Austrian oppression.  The ravages of the Imperialist

6635 and Spanish troops also powerfully aided him in these quarters;

6642 among the citizens opened to him, without a blow, the gates of the town

6653 Francis, Bishop of Wurtzburg, the bitter enemy of the Protestants,

6655 the indignation of Gustavus Adolphus.  A few threats gained for the Swedes

6659 The Bishops of Wurtzburg and Bamberg trembled in their castles;

6668 Roman Catholics hastened to secure by flight their property, their religion,

6670 The bishop himself set the example.  In the midst of the alarm,

6675 The further progress of Gustavus Adolphus in the ecclesiastical territories

6683 in the prelate's well-filled cellars; his treasures the bishop had

6684 in good time removed.  The whole bishopric followed the example

6685 of the capital, and submitted to the Swedes.  The king compelled

6686 all the bishop's subjects to swear allegiance to himself;

6689 which Gustavus took, he opened the churches to the Protestant people,

6697 to spare the blood of his enemies, as well as that of his own troops.

6699 On the first news of the Swedish irruption, the Bishop of Wurtzburg,

6702 to hasten to the assistance of the bishopric.  That defeated commander had,

6710 to Gustavus Adolphus.  But, in the event of Tilly's defeat,

6714 which compelled him to inactivity.  Thus his march to Franconia was delayed,

6715 and Gustavus Adolphus gained time to overrun the whole bishopric.

6720 perhaps) for having, by his scruples, occasioned the loss of the bishopric.

6728 Tilly, however, was not the sole enemy whom Gustavus Adolphus met

6732 against the Swedish hero, in the hope of obtaining from the Emperor

6740 Intoxicated with vain hopes, this prince collected a force of 17,000 men,

6741 which he proposed to lead in person against the Swedes.  If these troops

6762 the Bishop of Bamberg prudence.  To avert the plundering of his territories,

6764 the king's course till the arrival of assistance.  Gustavus Adolphus,

6766 the bishop's proposals, and named the conditions on which he was willing

6772 from the weak and terrified bishop.  This artful prelate

6775 than he threw himself under the protection of Tilly, and received the troops

6777 he had shown himself ready to open to the Swedes.  By this stratagem,

6778 however, he only delayed for a brief interval the ruin of his bishopric.

6780 the perfidy of the bishop; and the ecclesiastical territory became

6795 greatly facilitated the recruiting of his troops; a step which was

6802 to complete and retain his conquest.  He himself with his main army,

6813 of the oppressive burden of the Imperialists, the Count of Hanau

6816 Gustavus Adolphus now turned his whole attention to Frankfort,

6831 punish their opposition by the ruin of their commerce and prosperity.

6835 Gustavus Adolphus expressed to them his astonishment that,

6854 between the oppressor of Germany and its protector.  The menacing preparations

6855 amidst which Gustavus Adolphus now compelled them to decide,

6857 and by an appearance of compulsion justify the step which they willingly took.

6858 The gates were therefore opened to the King of Sweden, who marched his army

6873 he was even compelled to leave Magdeburg itself in their hands.

6877 with great resolution; but his garrison being too weak to oppose

6889 which they hoped would be sufficient to free them from

6890 the oppressive garrisons of the Imperialists.  The Bishop of Bremen,

6891 a relation of Gustavus Adolphus, was not content even with this;

6892 but assembled troops of his own, and terrified the unfortunate

6893 monks and priests of the neighbourhood, but was quickly compelled

6902 the greater part of Westphalia and Lower Saxony, the bishopric of Fulda,

6905 and Gustavus Adolphus at Werben, two imperial generals, Fugger and Altringer,

6912 surrendered to him, while his rapid advance alarmed the bishoprics of Fulda,

6917 his victorious army with that of Gustavus Adolphus, and concerted with him

6918 at Frankfort their future plan of operations.

6932 of the English court had abated the zeal of Gustavus Adolphus,

6935 of the oppressed, in which, on his invasion of Germany, he had so loudly

6938 The terrors of the king's irresistible strength, and the near prospect

6939 of his vengeance, had also compelled George, Landgrave of Hesse Darmstadt,

6961 which the Landgrave of Casse commanded.  Gustavus Adolphus had

6964 were preparing with all speed at Hoechst to carry his troops across the Rhine.

6969 than his confederates, the Bishops of Wurtzburg and Bamberg,

6982 accompanied by the Bishop of Worms, and carrying with him

6988 upon the city.  While one body of their troops poured into the Rheingau,

6992 had encamped at Cassel, opposite Mentz; and Bernhard, Duke of Weimar,

6999 The danger of Nuremberg, which, during the absence of Gustavus Adolphus

7010 with a view of approaching the town from an opposite quarter.

7021 the opposite bank, he crossed the river in a small boat;

7027 Scarcely had this officer time to entrench himself on the opposite bank,

7031 with fresh troops.  The Spaniards at last retired with the loss of 600 men,

7037 Gustavus Adolphus now conveyed his artillery and the greater part

7038 of his troops over the river, and laid siege to Oppenheim, which,

7047 the troops of Lorraine evacuated Worms, which, before their departure,

7049 to shut themselves up in Frankenthal, where they hoped to defy

7050 the victorious arms of Gustavus Adolphus.

7061 for storming the place.  The courage of the besieged now began to droop.

7088 of the most important towns upon the Rhine, from Boppart to Bacharach.

7090 by the Count of Wetterau, with the co-operation of the Swedes,

7093 openly declared for the Swedes; Spires offered troops for the king's service;

7100 his soldiers gained over those of the enemy.  But the exhausted troops

7112 he erected at the opposite angle which the Maine forms with the Rhine,

7121 While Gustavus Adolphus made himself master of the Rhine,

7129 the road into Bavaria and Austria lay open to him through Bamberg

7138 feel his power, while he gave time to his more formidable opponents

7150 with bitter complaints of the inactivity of the English court,

7154 A distrust of the Swedish monarch was now loud and open,

7162 of a victorious monarch of their party might revive their drooping spirit,

7164 even if Gustavus Adolphus was far from showing a disposition

7166 the King of France.  But the vindictive Bishop of Wurtzburg,

7185 and the enemy of the church, at last compelled Cardinal Richelieu

7192 on the part of Sweden, a complete neutrality, immediately they abandoned

7193 their alliance with the Emperor and withdrew their troops.

7194 Whatever the resolution these princes should adopt, Richelieu would

7197 and Gustavus Adolphus, freed from his other enemies in Germany, would be able

7202 in their opposition, and adhered to the Austrian alliance,

7204 sufficiently proved to all Europe the sincerity of her attachment to

7217 he hoped to secure the possession of the Palatinate.  But though

7219 Maximilian now thought proper to make use of it against the King of Sweden,

7232 Gustavus Adolphus had as grave reasons for desiring the contrary.

7237 from their open hostility, than from a neutrality which was so little

7246 The conditions, accordingly, upon which he offered to adopt the neutrality

7249 the recall of their troops from the imperial army, from the conquered towns,

7263 Far from intending to fetter his military operations by a truce with Sweden,

7272 of invading Germany from the Netherlands.  With this view, Gustavus Adolphus

7275 and a free passage granted to his troops through Coblentz.  But unwillingly

7279 Too weak to maintain his independence between two such powerful competitors,

7286 to this bold step was not completely gained, for the offended pride

7287 of Gustavus Adolphus was not appeased till he had obtained a free passage

7288 for his troops through Treves.

7292 and Gustavus himself completed the conquest of this district

7300 whom Gustavus had left there with 8,000 men; and the Bishopric of Bamberg,

7303 to his general the chastisement of the bishop, whose perfidy had excited

7305 In a short time, he subdued the greater part of the bishopric;

7307 was carried by storm.  The banished bishop urgently demanded assistance

7310 to restore the bishop to his possessions, this general collected his troops,

7316 A panic which suddenly seized his troops, and which no presence of mind

7317 of their general could check, opened the gates to the enemy,

7318 and it was with difficulty that the troops, baggage, and artillery,

7323 put a stop to Tilly's conquests, and compelled him to provide

7326 The king made a general review of his troops at Aschaffenburg.

7335 that should be left open to Count Tilly.  It was dangerous,

7349 completed the impression produced by his glorious exploits,

7357 Rodolph Maximilian, Duke of Saxe Lauenburg, showed at first

7359 But the vigour with which Gustavus Adolphus prosecuted the siege,

7360 soon compelled him to take measures for a speedy and secure retreat,

7364 The conquest of Donauwerth opened to the king the further side of the Danube,

7369 the remainder of their course.  On the opposite bank of the Lech,

7377 with all the troops he could collect, threw himself into Tilly's camp,

7378 as if all his hopes centred on this single point, and here the good fortune

7381 Gustavus Adolphus, after subduing the whole territory of Augsburg,

7382 on his own side of the river, and opening to his troops a rich supply

7384 opposite the Bavarian entrenchments.  It was now the month of March,

7388 with certain destruction, while from the opposite side the enemy's cannon

7390 both of fire and water, they should accomplish this almost impossible passage,

7391 a fresh and vigorous enemy awaited the exhausted troops

7402 and a troop of honourable warriors, who had grown gray in the field,

7415 drove the Bavarians from the opposite bank, he caused to be erected

7420 the courage of his troops, and discharged more than 60 cannon

7423 as the Swedish batteries swept the lower opposite bank, while their height

7424 served as a breast-work to their own troops.  In vain, therefore,

7426 of the Swedes threw them into disorder, and the bridge was completed

7428 in his power to encourage his troops; and no danger could drive him

7430 a cannon ball shattered his leg; and Altringer, his brave companion-in-arms,

7433 and Maximilian, in spite of his own judgment, was driven to adopt

7442 did Gustavus Adolphus, who completed the passage of the river

7447 never would I have abandoned a position like this, and laid open my territory

7464 the superior generalship of Gustavus Adolphus, he lost,

7474 the command of the Danube, and to keep open the communication with Bohemia.

7477 Gustavus Adolphus commenced the siege of Ingolstadt, hoping to gain the town

7486 and quieted the fears of his troops by immediately mounting another horse.

7490 quickly changed the king's plan of operations.  He had flattered himself

7491 with the hope of gaining this town, which favoured the Protestant cause,

7497 both his time and his troops, and penetrated into the interior of Bavaria,

7501 The whole country, as far as Munich, now lay open to the conqueror.

7504 to oppose his progress, he had to contend against a still more implacable

7506 Soldiers who did not believe in the Pope were, in this country,

7515 to a fearful retaliation.  Gustavus Adolphus, alone, sullied the lustre

7518 from the obligations of humanity towards that unfortunate people,

7524 placed all its hopes in the magnanimity of the conqueror.

7525 By an unconditional and voluntary surrender, it hoped to disarm his vengeance;

7533 of conducting the Palatine Frederick with the pomp of a victor

7552 concealed in one of the largest, completed the pleasure

7569 with an enemy able to cope with him.  A part of Bavaria and Swabia,

7570 the Bishoprics of Franconia, the Lower Palatinate, and the Archbishopric

7573 had fully justified the plan of operations which he had formed

7588 had been glad to adopt a neutrality.  Even the numerous garrisons

7594 While Gustavus Adolphus thus maintained his superiority within the empire,

7602 of the Austrian garrisons from the entire circle.  Reinforced by the troops

7605 Rudolph von Tiefenbach, in order to chastise the Elector

7609 when his destructive progress was suddenly stopped, by an express mandate

7618 of so powerful an ally, he had opened, through the intervention of Spain,

7635 of oppression and tyranny.  On every side, this unfortunate country

7637 their proprietors, and groaned under the hated yoke of Roman Catholic masters,

7645 enjoyed their patrimony.  Still more insupportable than the oppression

7648 No external danger, no opposition on the part of the nation,

7654 from this violence.  Two imperial commissaries, accompanied by

7656 in this peaceful valley to preach the gospel to the heretics.

7660 of this small district compelled the Emperor disgracefully to recall

7663 and seemed to justify every act of oppression which their insolence

7682 while the weakness of the garrison left no room to hope a long resistance.

7687 the favourable opportunity to satiate his thirst for revenge.

7701 At last, to render the consternation general and complete,

7705 by all the Roman Catholic nobility, the generals with their troops,

7706 the clergy, and all the officers of the crown.  All night the people

7719 more than a hostile reception.  From the concurrent reports of these people,

7720 the Saxons learned that the town had been deserted by the troops,

7735 was to secure their properties and liberties by an advantageous capitulation.

7737 than the gates were opened, without farther opposition; and upon

7743 was not to be dissolved by the step they had taken.  In proportion as

7746 of the Elector, and the discipline of his troops.  Field-Marshal Arnheim

7763 he appropriated and transported to Dresden the cannon of the former.

7782 was his first care.  The exiles again took possession of their properties,

7783 without thinking of recompensing for the purchase money

7794 and to convert their immoveable into transferable property.

7798 to the newly opened Protestant churches.  Many, whom fear alone had retained

7799 in their adherence to Popery, now openly professed the new doctrine;

7801 a compulsory persuasion, to follow the earlier conviction of their conscience.

7803 of that just displeasure, which this persecuted people felt

7804 against their oppressors.  They made a fearful and cruel use

7806 their hatred of the religion which they had been compelled to profess,

7820 Brilliant and promising as the opening of the Bohemian campaign had been,

7821 the issue by no means satisfied the expectations of Gustavus Adolphus.

7837 as well as the confidence inspired by constant success; its troops had lost

7843 to the seductive proposition of neutrality; while his suspicious alliance

7845 The bishops of Wurtzburg and Bamberg, the Elector of Mentz,

7856 encouraged by their protector's success, were openly and actively declaring

7858 by the violent and oppressive extortions of Tilly and Wallenstein

7861 as before at the cost of others.  To complete his embarrassment,

7873 in Italy and in Catalonia, the ruin of Austria would be complete;

7884 by any higher authority, was complete master of every favourable opportunity,

7885 could control all his means to the accomplishment of his ends,

7889 over their troops, and liberty of acting at their discretion;

7890 the soldiers were deficient in discipline and obedience; the scattered corps

7891 in combined operation; the states in attachment to the cause;

7906 and divided the opinions of its members.  In order to oppose one monarch

7908 of the troops, Ferdinand, in the ardour of the moment, had offered himself

7918 and the attachment of the people, whose co-operation was indispensable to him

7920 could venture to impose new burdens on a people already severely oppressed;

7923 of his name, restore the neglected discipline of the troops

7935 of counsel and support!  How hazardous to oppose to the greatest general

7944 the scourge of his people, and the oppressor of the territories

7948 be found for the general.  Since the compulsory resignation of Wallenstein,

7956 should be fit to cope with the experienced troops of the northern conqueror?

7957 In all Europe, there was but one man equal to this, and that one

7965 he had lost his right arm.  Every defeat of his troops opened afresh

7969 he had only lost a leader of his troops, and a defender of his dominions;

7975 the haughty duke had beheld these changes of fortune with affected composure,

7976 and concealed, under a glittering and theatrical pomp, the dark designs

7987 now appeared to him just and pure.  In proportion as the external circle

7988 of his operations was narrowed, the world of hope expanded before him,

8000 he compared the authority which he had possessed, with that which

8012 Gustavus Adolphus had overrun the north of Germany; one place after another

8019 For him was Gustavus Adolphus labouring.  Scarce had the king begun

8025 15,000 men from the king; and with these, and the troops he himself

8028 Welcome as was this unexpected proposition, its extravagant promises

8029 were naturally calculated to excite suspicion.  Gustavus Adolphus

8037 in openly avowing himself a traitor.  He excused himself, therefore,

8040 and thus, perhaps, by excess of caution, lost an opportunity

8048 they could not long have co-operated in an enterprise,

8057 so irksome to the Duke of Friedland, in the conduct of combined operations,

8062 and the majesty of royalty, as to bestow the recompense

8065 In him, therefore, even if all Europe should tacitly acquiesce,

8066 Wallenstein had reason to expect the most decided and formidable opponent

8067 to his views on the Bohemian crown; and in all Europe he was the only one

8068 who could enforce his opposition.  Constituted Dictator in Germany

8080 he hoped to obtain with less difficulty and more advantage

8082 to his views, as he had always been doubtful of Gustavus Adolphus.

8218 and deigned to favour the ambassadors with a ray of hope.

8234 regarded as chimerical, and which Gustavus Adolphus had considered

8247 rather than be the victim of its oppression.  All the Austrian provinces

8513 left him without excuse, and the conquests of Gustavus Adolphus in Bavaria

8520 Gustavus Adolphus, too weak in numbers to cope even with

8525 effectual co-operation improbable; when the event contradicted his views,

8556 terminated in a mutual compromise to Wallenstein's advantage.

8560 He retained only the bare right of punishing and rewarding his own troops,

8568 they publicly embraced in the sight of their troops, and made

8584 from the Danube, and deliver Bavaria.  Saxony had been stripped of troops

8589 Gustavus Adolphus himself, fully persuaded that Wallenstein's views

8600 before he had time to concentrate his troops, which were scattered

8614 to hazard life and property in the common cause, animated the inhabitants

8624 and, in a fortnight, this great work was completed.

8648 he did nothing to fulfil his promise; and even let slip the opportunity

8653 enterprises on which younger soldiers rush, in the hope of gaining a name.

8656 he resolved to wear out the ardour of his opponent by a tedious blockade,

8657 and by thus depriving him of every opportunity of availing himself

8661 and opposite Nuremberg; and, by this well chosen position,

8664 and flattered himself with the hope of slowly, but surely,

8665 wearing out by famine and pestilence the courage of his opponent

8671 the neighbouring country, the peasantry had fled with their property;

8679 without a numerous escort.  And when this supply failed, the town opened

8680 its magazines to the King, but Wallenstein had to support his troops

8682 with an escort of a thousand men.  Gustavus Adolphus having received

8689 which Wallenstein had sent forward to Altdorp to cover the entrance

8698 from which he could supply his loss of troops.  The want of provisions,

8700 rendered it uncertain which party would be first compelled to give way.

8706 and a crowded population, had occasioned a greater loss than the sword.

8713 drawn together a corps from the garrisons in Lower Saxony and Thuringia,

8715 and at Kitzingen by the corps of the Rhine, which the Landgrave of Hesse,

8726 fighting men; a formidable force, opposed to another not less formidable.

8727 The war seemed at length compressed to the point of a single battle,

8729 Europe looked with anxiety to this scene, where the whole strength

8758 To put an end to these distresses, Gustavus Adolphus, relying on

8767 nor the ridicule of his opponent, could shake his purpose.  Gustavus,

8768 deceived in his hope of forcing a battle, and compelled by

8791 the open jaws of death.  The assault was furious, the resistance obstinate.

8793 and infuriate by the prospect of inevitable death, these determined warriors

8796 At the same moment, the heavy cavalry rushed forward into the openings

8835 with his exhausted troops; and vanquished for the first time,

8836 even because he was not victor, he led back his troops over the Rednitz.

8877 Nuremberg had lost more than 10,000 of its inhabitants, and Gustavus Adolphus

8906 mustered his troops.  He found this force, which so lately had amounted

8912 the expectations of Europe.  The king's conquests in Bavaria, were,

8919 the opportunity of separating from this burdensome associate, and prosecuting,

8922 for his winter quarters, hoping by his destructive presence

8927 they had gained several advantages over the Emperor's troops.

8935 the rich country of Bavaria to the Swedes, he hoped to be left unmolested

8941 with the small remains of his troops, while the imperial army,

8950 the diminished army of the duke, and to complete the miseries

8959 in the Circle of Leipzig, and compelled the city, after a short resistance,

8964 arrival at Erfurt gave an unexpected check to his operations.

9009 and to sacrifice his own brilliant prospects to the safety of this ally.

9011 and the weakness of the Elector of Bavaria gave him hopes of soon forcing

9013 of the peasantry in Upper Austria, opened to him a passage into that country,

9025 Rapidly assembling his troops in Franconia, he followed

9033 He reached Naumburg on the 1st November, 1632, before the corps,

9039 everywhere attended his progress; the people knelt before him,

9043 "Is it not," said he, "as if this people would make a God of me?

9044 Our affairs prosper, indeed; but I fear the vengeance of Heaven

9061 hopes of victory, if he could compel the king to give battle

9069 of a few troops, be rendered almost impassable.  If attacked there,

9074 But the rapidity with which Gustavus Adolphus had taken possession

9084 he called a council of war, in order to have the opinion of his most

9097 an attack from the King, he put his troops into winter-quarters,

9101 of the fortress of Moritzburg, in the territory of Halle.  Different corps

9109 Scarcely had Gustavus Adolphus been informed of Pappenheim's departure,

9116 than 12,000 men to oppose to the 20,000 of the enemy, he might hope

9126 the light troops of the Duke of Friedland, under the command

9130 of that name, and formed in line below Lutzen, opposite the Imperialists.

9135 but so that the cavalry of both extended themselves along the opposite side.

9140 Wallenstein, to the great disadvantage of his opponent, had possessed himself

9153 and posted on the left wing, but only until Pappenheim's troops arrived.

9157 On the evening of the same day, Gustavus Adolphus appeared

9158 on the opposite plain, and formed his troops in the order of attack.

9161 among the divisions of the infantry, and troops of musketeers

9169 in order to excite the emulation of the two nations to a noble competition.

9177 The strained expectation of Europe, so disappointed before Nuremberg,

9181 been cooled by so awful a hazard, or hope animated by so glorious a prize.

9182 Europe was next day to learn who was her greatest general: --  to-morrow,

9186 or to the incompetency of his opponent; whether the services of Wallenstein

9193 to which it was to be opposed:  and the anxiety which each in vain

9194 attempted to repress, was a convincing proof of their opponent's strength.

9199 and the whole army, at the same moment dropping on their knees,

9200 burst into a moving hymn, accompanied by the military music.  The king

9203 rode along the ranks, to animate the courage of his troops

9219 But here the genius of Wallenstein opposed itself to their progress.

9221 his discomfited troops; and his powerful word was itself sufficient

9222 to stop the flight of the fugitives.  Supported by three regiments of cavalry,

9274 to the corporal.

9278 of destroying the courage of these brave troops, it but excited it into a new,

9296 Swedish valour to complete the defeat.  The imperial powder-waggons took fire,

9308 while his troops were still plundering the town.  It was impossible

9312 he galloped at full speed for Lutzen, to share in the battle.

9316 the flying troops, and led them once more against the enemy.

9321 Pappenheim's unexpected appearance revived the drooping courage

9348 where he thought his noble opponent was most surely to be met.

9356 "Tell the Duke of Friedland," said he, "that I lie without hope of life,

9366 Gotz, Terzky, Colloredo, and Piccolomini, compelled to keep their ground.

9367 The Swedish infantry, with prompt determination, profited by

9397 of the battle, they retired to Leipzig, where they hoped to join

9405 to oppose any attempt the enemy might make to recover it.

9420 with a few troops, he made an impetuous attack on a regiment of the enemy,

9449 of fixing there his winter quarters, openly confessed his defeat.

9463 the corpse of the king was discovered, not far from the great stone,

9490 and compared with the magnanimous tears of Alexander, for the fall of Darius,

9499 the glory of ending the career of Gustavus Adolphus.

9501 not to excite in his bitter opponent a ready suspicion, that what was

9514 which he had committed against Gustavus Adolphus, in the queen's chamber,

9535 of Wallenstein, being charged with being an accomplice of that general,

9543 for imputing it to him.  Gustavus Adolphus, it is well known,

9558 is the sudden retirement of Gustavus Adolphus from the scene; --

9559 stopping for a time the whole movement of the political machine,

9566 The Protestant party had identified its hopes with its invincible leader,

9570 Gustavus Adolphus had already terminated; and now the greatest service

9579 and the Swedish power, now incapable of sinking into the oppressor,

9589 and by principles and enthusiasm a determined enemy to Popery,

9613 the honourable title of protector of the oppressed, he eluded that obligation.

9633 of the Goths, and restore to Europe the balance of power.

9645 The weak bond of union, by which Gustavus Adolphus contrived to hold together

9651 the prey of an enemy, whom, by their union alone, they had been able to oppose

9658 to the allied powers.  With the death of Gustavus Adolphus,

9659 the enemy had formed new hopes; and however gloomy might be

9667 of their enemies?  He was not likely to sacrifice such prospects,

9682 and the mutual obligation of the states seemed to cease with the hopes

9688 to abandon the alliance; others, oppressed by the heavy burdens

9692 and no one would stoop to receive orders from another.

9700 in this trying conjuncture.  The wide reaching mind of Gustavus Adolphus

9702 to a rank among the powers of Europe, which it could not retain

9714 of Gustavus Adolphus, to be richly repaid by the grateful monarch

9716 this hope vanished, and the deluded people now loudly demanded relief

9719 But the spirit of Gustavus Adolphus still lived in the men to whom

9747 The death of Gustavus Adolphus had put an end to the jealousy of Denmark,

9798 would be cheaply purchased with the few troops they sacrificed to them,

9800 composed for the most part of Germans, and with the honourable superintendence

9801 of all the operations, both military and political.

9805 which necessarily accompanies all the movements of a council.

9807 To one comprehensive mind must be intrusted the management

9813 to enforce united and combined operations, to give effect to his orders,

9818 and in the relations of all the states of Europe, was unquestionably

9819 the fittest instrument to carry out the plans of Gustavus Adolphus

9830 all the obstacles which would oppose the execution of his plans,

9837 to revive the drooping courage of the weaker states,

9846 the course pursued, which of these alternatives they would adopt.

9852 became opened to their true interests, and they were instigated

9856 the regency and their minister, a precious opportunity of action would,

9879 Less apprehensive of open enemies, than of the jealousy

9891 indeed, showed them openly enough by forbidding the Swedes from recruiting

9902 the See of Magdeburg, the bishop of which had the power of assembling

9904 and by this spirited proceeding, put a stop for the present

9918 He himself opened the proceedings, and conducted the deliberations.

9942 raised among the states, gave rise to a thousand complaints;

9943 and the outrages committed by the troops, in their marches and quarters,

9946 In the service of two absolute monarchs, Oxenstiern had but little opportunity

9948 of republican deliberations, or to bear opposition with patience.

9951 he was at a loss to comprehend the inconsistency of most men,

9953 Prompt and impetuous by nature, he was so on this occasion from principle;

9973 it was proposed, not without French influence, to appoint

9976 as to the levies, marches, and quarterings of the troops.

10004 A few weeks after the death of Gustavus Adolphus, sorrow ended the days

10006 the pomp of his protector's court, and expended on it the small remainder

10008 and the prospect of a brighter future was opening, when death deprived him

10013 and the good opinion of the Reformed States were indispensable,

10024 Impartiality, the most sacred obligation of the historian, here compels us

10041 Munster, and Fulda; to Duke Bernard of Weimar, the Franconian Bishoprics;

10054 the troops of Saxony and Lunenburg united with the Swedish main body;

10084 Duke Bernard, soon after the opening of the campaign of 1633,

10090 now threatened Bavaria with a fearful inroad.  The bishopric of Eichstadt

10091 was completely overrun, and Ingoldstadt was on the point of being delivered up

10096 of the Swedish arms in this quarter, when the operations of the army

10097 were at once stopped by a mutiny among the officers.

10116 the soldier had no other recompense than the doubtful chance

10118 During the lifetime of Gustavus Adolphus, the combined influence

10119 of fear and hope had suppressed any open complaint, but after his death,

10144 to comply with these demands; and in case of refusal, they announced

10150 to the other troops, and he should be deserted by all his armies at once.

10156 of appeasing the discontented troops; but, aware of his importance,

10157 he embraced the opportunity to make advantageous stipulations for himself,

10160 Gustavus Adolphus had flattered him with the promise of the Duchy

10161 of Franconia, to be formed out of the Bishoprics of Wurtzburg and Bamberg,

10169 He therefore granted to him the Franconian bishoprics,

10180 however, the opportunity for a great undertaking had been lost,

10181 and the united generals divided their forces to oppose the enemy

10196 convenient opportunity of doing.  He, therefore, after an ineffectual attempt,

10206 with his corps.  Upon the first intelligence of their approach,

10239 which the dying Tilly left to the Elector; and Gustavus Adolphus

10245 The garrison consisted of not more than fifteen companies,

10262 Meanwhile the Bavarian commandant of Ratisbon, in the hope

10297 his victorious campaign, and allowed his troops their well-earned repose

10308 Count Wasaburg, a natural son of Gustavus Adolphus, showed himself

10323 who distinguished themselves in this campaign, none could be compared

10326 The fall of his great rival had left the whole theatre of glory open to him;

10327 all Europe was now attentively awaiting those exploits, which should efface

10332 to friend and foe -- the terror, and, at the same time, the last hope

10338 by splendid monuments.  During the winter, he oppressed the imperial provinces

10342 to open the campaign, with this well-chosen and well-appointed army,

10356 Arnheim and Thurn contended for the chief command; the troops of

10362 to remove their property without hindrance, and many did not affect to conceal

10366 prevailed between the troops.  General Arnheim, too,

10370 His army amounted to 40,000 men, while to oppose him the allies had

10374 his intrenchments, and marched slowly and with composure to the enemy's camp.

10377 the opportunity of fighting.  The caution with which he avoided a battle

10403 indemnified by stated payments, and all the superfluous troops on both sides

10428 of that jealous prince, as well as the complaints of the Austrian subjects

10429 against his boundless oppression; his fidelity was questioned,

10441 of authority over the troops.  As this disadvantageous contract

10453 of the compact, to the Cardinal Infante; the Italian army continued its march,

10460 he must accelerate the accomplishment of his long meditated designs.

10461 He secured the attachment of his troops by removing the doubtful officers,

10466 against the author of his own good fortune, he founded all his hopes

10470 to consent, on their own discretion, to such important proposals as those

10495 with Gustavus Adolphus, he could not credit the possibility

10506 that the whole proposal was only a snare to disarm the allies,

10507 and to betray the flower of their troops into the hands of the Emperor.

10512 of their best troops, he declared to Arnheim that they must begin

10548 surprised the Swedish army in the most complete security.  Their cavalry

10550 and the infantry completely surrounded at Steinau by the duke's army

10554 The army surrendered, and the most complete victory was obtained

10569 of their hopes they could not pardon.  "What should I have done

10659 soon convinced the Duke that the compact with himself

10684 to increase the number of his adherents, could stoop to the lowest means.

10704 before he could venture to lay aside the mask, or take any open step

10718 spoke of the dangers and obstacles which would oppose so hazardous

10721 propitious to him, the opportunity the best that could be wished for,

10725 Wallenstein's suspicions by longer opposition, and yielded apparently

10761 the common case with energetic and daring minds, he stopped not to consider

10762 the magnitude and the number of the difficulties that opposed him.

10775 the soldiers' feelings of allegiance were the rock on which his hopes

10796 the Duke of Friedland alone had hitherto opposed this tyranny,

10806 that the six thousand troops were required for the Cardinal Infante;

10808 that they were now called on, in this inhospitable season,

10812 intended for the pay of the troops.  The general, abandoned by the court,

10837 and to shed their last drop of blood in his defence.  Whoever should break

10854 in fact, artfully contrived to substitute for the first another copy,

10871 he gave vent to his injured pride in undignified complaints and reproaches.

10875 against the court, he reminded them of their opposition to the proposition

10885 reached them on their journey, and suddenly stopped their further progress.

10897 till the regular forms of justice were complied with.  Secret instructions

10901 till they should have an opportunity of being heard, and of answering

10902 for their conduct; but if this could not be accomplished quietly,

10955 to oppose with energy the designs of the traitor.

10961 as the result of his pride, which never retracted the opinion

10985 and openly to declare against the Emperor.  All the troops were to assemble

10988 the operations of the duke, with the Swedish troops, and to effect a diversion

10996 his generals, the desertion of his troops, the discovery of his whole plot,

10999 all his hopes annihilated.  He stood alone, abandoned by all

11009 to embrace the favourable opportunity, and to offer him their protection.

11067 the most rapid measures against the public enemy.  The opportunity

11121 cried Neumann, "and then he hopes to bathe his hands in Austrian blood."

11136 and pierced with ten wounds.  The deed was no sooner accomplished,

11145 Finding the troops well disposed, he exacted from them a new oath of fidelity

11151 guarded by a numerous and trusty body of troops, sufficient to prevent

11158 the very corpses of his murdered associates, even these furious men

11162 clothed with all the pomp of military greatness, and long-accustomed awe

11175 with prophetic spirit.  "IT IS," replied the Duke, who would give the law

11176 even to heaven.  "But," he continued with equally prophetic spirit,

11189 from within, and burst it open.

11199 cried Deveroux to him, "who intends to deliver up the Emperor's troops

11407 were applied to for troops and money; and, driven to the last extremity,

11427 had been seen in the conduct of France towards the bishoprics of Metz,

11433 the hope of adding Alsace to its large and numerous possessions,

11435 for the partition of the Spanish Netherlands -- the prospect of making

11479 and seduced by the tempting propositions of the House of Austria,

11488 which formerly had been thronged with a happy and industrious population,

11489 where nature had lavished her choicest gifts, and plenty and prosperity

11492 and no sooner had the young crops given the promise of a smiling harvest,

11494 the last hope of an afflicted peasantry.  Burnt castles, wasted fields,

11499 The only safeguard against oppression was to become an oppressor.  The towns

11501 who seized and wasted the property of the citizens, and, under the license

11510 than enemies.  The neglected farms, the destruction of the crops,

11514 in the crops.  The crowding together of men in camps and quarters --

11522 No station was too dignified for outrage, no property too holy

11536 But, in truth, it was not merely interested voices which opposed a peace;

11547 the burdens they had borne so long, and to reap at last some recompense

11564 shut out any reasonable prospect of effective assistance on their part.

11582 as a formal decree of the Empire.  Whoever opposed it, was to be treated

11584 compelled to acknowledge a law, in the passing of which they had no share.

11595 Before the expiration of this term a commission, composed of equal numbers

11605 of Saxony, and Halberstadt in that of the Archduke Leopold William.

11619 all which had been appropriated by the foreign powers of France and Sweden,

11620 was to be forcibly wrested from them by the united powers.  The troops

11657 at the expense of the true church.  In the opinion of the latter,

11668 most of the Protestant states compelled by necessity to embrace this peace.

11686 for their opposition.  Invited to Germany by the Germans themselves,

11690 disappointed in all their hopes, without reward and without gratitude

11707 was the more severe, because the Swedes had calculated upon being recompensed

11714 Never, in the whole course of the war, had the prospects of the Swedes

11717 the free cities, abandoned them to benefit by the peace; others were compelled

11726 and this severe loss checked the activity of France.  To complete

11742 the more provinces and magazines were opened to his troops.

11761 of Gustavus Adolphus, without any open or formal breach,

11770 had the death of Gustavus Adolphus, and the desperate situation

11774 which the ambition and vigilance of Gustavus Adolphus placed upon her plans

11775 of aggrandizement, France availed herself of the favourable opportunity

11786 called for more active measures, she seized the sword, and astonished Europe

11790 Animated by this powerful co-operation, the Swedes and Germans awoke from

11791 the consternation, and hoped, sword in hand, to obtain a more honourable peace

11800 her operations by liberating it from all fear of a Polish war.

11806 of Gustavus Adolphus.  The treaty of Beerwald was, with certain modifications,

11808 at Compiegne, and afterwards at Wismar and Hamburg.  France had already come

11814 compelled the Emperor to divide his force.

11825 by a decided majority of votes, notwithstanding the opposition of Treves,

11828 against him, and drawn its troops into the heart of the kingdom.

11830 one firm and compactly united power; the Emperor, with the German states

11834 their German allies, or accounting to them for the plans which they adopted,

11840 had comparatively little influence upon the course of the war.

11845 The archbishopric of Magdeburg which, by the treaty, was ceded to

11856 Reinforced by the troops and artillery, which had hitherto been employed

11903 and their friends inspired with new hopes.  Banner instantly followed up

11916 all his hopes on the Duchy of Franconia, while the weakness of the Swedes,

11920 the only aid which he required, and France readily acceded to his proposals.

11945 He began his operations upon the Rhine, where another French army,

11955 he led back his exhausted troops into Alsace and Swabia.

11956 At the opening of the next campaign, he passed the Rhine at Breysach,

11962 But an insignificant fortress in Franche Comte completely checked

11971 of the French arms in the Netherlands had cheated the activity of operations

11974 and with unlimited command of his troops, Duke Bernard,

11976 in the bishopric of Basle, and unexpectedly appeared upon the Rhine,

11982 and compelled the Duke of Weimar, with great loss to retire.

11990 of such distinguished prisoners, and by the pomp of military trophies,

11991 to withdraw the attention of the populace from the public distress.

11998 and his projects expanded in proportion as fortune favoured him.

12013 accompanied by 3000 waggons loaded with provisions, which he intended

12024 The capture of Breysach opened a boundless field to the ambition

12025 of the Duke of Weimar, and the romance of his hopes was fast approaching

12030 and excited by the boldest hopes, he believed that he should be able

12033 was of importance, when troops and generals were of more value

12037 of accomplishing the boldest and largest designs.  In order to secure himself

12067 and to secure his troops.  These intrigues were no secret to the duke,

12070 had the most prejudicial influence upon his future operations.

12072 against an attack on the side of France, compelled him to divide

12073 his military strength, while the stoppage of his subsidies delayed

12077 his plan of operations to Banner, who was about to carry the war

12088 their greatest general after Gustavus Adolphus, France a formidable competitor

12090 the duties of a soldier and a general in the school of Gustavus Adolphus,

12101 is to be measured by a different standard from that of ordinary people.

12102 Capable of accomplishing more, he might venture to form more daring plans.

12118 that at this time the justice of the cause was comparatively unimportant,

12119 and the extent of the recompense the main object to which the soldier looked;

12122 outbade all competitors:  it bought over General Erlach,

12127 an unsuccessful campaign against the Emperor, saw his hopes again deceived.

12128 Although intending to do France so ill a service, as to compete with her

12131 was glad to seize any opportunity to frustrate his views.  He accordingly

12136 began to make open war upon the Emperor.

12145 the happiness of a people, and by nature gentle and humane,

12149 converted into the oppressor of mankind, the enemy of peace,

12150 and the scourge of his people.  Amiable in domestic life,

12161 and Europe was in flames.

12166 had been a closer witness of the sufferings of the people,

12171 He did so, and ultimately restored to Europe the blessing of peace,

12179 taken up their winter quarters in Saxony; and the campaign of 1637 opened

12183 was compelled to retreat into Torgau.  But the superior number

12186 he had no course open to him but to attempt a highly dangerous retreat

12202 his position seemed hopeless, and the Imperialists were already triumphing

12212 In the hope of drawing the enemy by stratagem from the Oder, Banner pretended

12219 about a mile above Custrin, with his troops, baggage, and artillery,

12233 to the extent of her ability, both with troops and money.

12239 the princes of Mecklenburg, closely pressed by the troops of the Emperor,

12245 by no means justified the pompous expectations which had accompanied

12246 the opening of the campaign.  Every place which the Swedes had held

12260 a favourable opportunity openly to declare herself.  By artful delays,

12262 in keeping him inactive, till she had concluded a secret compact with France,

12268 Raising troops in Holland with English money, he formed a magazine at Meppen,

12272 and thereby facilitated the operations of the Swedes in other quarters.

12277 Under these advantages, and reinforced by 14,000 fresh troops

12278 from Sweden and Livonia.  Banner opened, with the most favourable prospects,

12284 and quarterings of the troops, that, in order to support his army

12295 while the prosperity of the Austrian provinces excited his hopes of booty.

12310 The Archduke Leopold, brother to the Emperor, assumed the command,

12324 the treaty of Prague, and joined Banner with the very troops which,

12332 divided corps, but the attempt was frustrated by the skill of the Bavarian

12336 famine and the severity of the winter compelled them both to retire.

12341 At this period, a diet was held in Ratisbon, where the complaints

12345 in the Electoral College, the great number of bishops,

12347 gave the Emperor a complete command of the deliberations of the assembly,

12348 and rendered this diet any thing but a fair representative of the opinions

12358 were frozen, he broke up from his quarters in Lunenburg.  Accompanied by

12373 and comfortable quarters awaited his troops.  Guebriant, however,

12402 greater in adversity than in prosperity, and never more formidable

12407 he oppressed the German princes no less by his haughtiness,

12417 were the trophies of his victories.  The want of this great general

12426 the number of the army; the troops of France and Weimar showed little zeal;

12435 At length appeared the new Swedish generalissimo, with fresh troops and money.

12436 This was Bernard Torstensohn, a pupil of Gustavus Adolphus,

12439 he surpassed all his opponents in activity; and his enterprises had wings,

12441 Under him, the scene of war was changed, and new maxims adopted,

12463 But, in the mean time, Piccolomini and the Archduke Leopold had collected

12472 Torstensohn now threatened Leipzig with a siege, and hoped to raise

12473 a large supply of provisions and contributions from that prosperous town,

12476 The Imperialists, under Leopold and Piccolomini, immediately hastened

12480 eleven years before, Gustavus Adolphus had rendered remarkable

12485 before it was completely formed, that the whole cavalry that covered it

12492 till at last the Imperialists, completely surrounded,

12493 after a contest of three hours, were compelled to abandon the field.

12494 The generals on both sides had more than once to rally their flying troops;

12495 and the Archduke Leopold, with his regiment, was the first in the attack

12504 where its shattered regiments reassembled.  The Archduke Leopold

12514 brilliant result.  The city was obliged to clothe the Swedish troops anew,

12520 hoping by his perseverance to weary out the obstinacy of the besieged.

12523 compelled him, with his weakened army, to retire.  He considered it, however,

12542 in other parts of the empire.  The troops of Hesse, under Count Eberstein,

12546 the imperial general Hatzfeldt, and assembled his own troops

12550 This important victory opened to them the whole Electorate

12557 the operations of Torstensohn in Saxony.  But instead of joining the Swedes,

12573 and was the cause of the inaction of its troops in the field.

12581 proved the sincerity of his opinion, that the German army

12585 and to encourage the troops to bear the fatigues of the German war,

12600 in complete security, without expectation of a hostile attack.

12610 in this war, and which, being commonly accompanied by confusion,

12656 where he astonished his troops by informing them that he was leading them

12674 food and employment to the troops; that good winter quarters

12690 justified even greater hopes, if only the attempt were executed

12695 before even an attack was expected.  The Swedish troops,

12698 Another army penetrated into Schonen, which made as little opposition;

12705 and all things threatened the speedy fulfilment of the old prophecy

12714 had resumed the supreme command of the troops.  Gallas accordingly appeared

12715 in the duchy, took Keil, and hoped, by forming a junction with the Danes,

12718 and the Archbishop of Bremen, the son of Christian IV.; and afterwards

12743 hastened in person to Prague, in order to animate the courage of the people

12746 he hoped in the immediate neighbourhood of the war to be able

12754 in a dream, and given him the strongest assurances of a complete victory.

12788 that of his predecessor; Upper Hungary was already inundated by his troops,

12793 at length adopted the last and only expedient which remained,

12800 Reinforced with fresh troops from France, which the great Turenne,

12807 was compelled to retreat.  Mazarin shed tears over this great loss,

12822 But these wild undisciplined hordes, instead of seconding the operations

12837 a Swedish deserter, who had no hope of pardon.  The ravages

12840 with the sudden retreat of the Prince of Transylvania, at last compelled

12843 he at last relinquished his intended plan of operations against

12847 whither he was followed by the Imperialists, under the Archduke Leopold.

12857 to the Swedish party.  Denmark had been compelled to a peace,

12874 to recruit the defeated army, and the Bavarians were in turn compelled

12878 of the Duke of Enghien.  In person, he led on his troops

12887 of the Hessians, and the Bavarians being reinforced by the Archduke Leopold,

12893 of the Swedish army, which, besides Koenigsmark's flying corps

12898 moved against Wrangel, in the hope of being able to overwhelm him

12904 was joined by the flying corps of Koenigsmark.  But Turenne,

12910 his just demand, and a longer opposition might have excited distrust

12922 by which he hoped to give a new turn to the war.  He, too, had adopted

12925 he hoped to gain his end with more certainty by another way.

12928 A similar design had been formerly conceived by Gustavus Adolphus,

12934 obliged him to halt in his victorious career, and lead back his troops.

12935 Wrangel now hoped to accomplish the obj
