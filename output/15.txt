740 asleep on the sweet hay, where the curious grasshoppers peered at her

781 merriest tricks before him, or rolled her tiny hoop with shouts of

789 struggles of a drowning fly; in Nature's company she played as with an

829 face saddened, and, stooping downward, folded Sunny in its arms as if to

837 child's wide blue eyes were open, full of supernatural calm; her parched

1137   How have you travelled? I wonder;--was Mr. Claude your companion?

1140   Taking the steamer, and stopping, as you had advised, at Bellaggio;

1425   Forthwith every thought of the poor little possible hope, which

1491 confused, comprehensive or narrow, exactly in proportion to the weight

1497 which developes dim tendencies into positive sentiments, sentiments into

1611 all opponents who understood it not, and baffled the efforts of all who

1641 poetry,--with Plato and Bacon, in philosophy,--with Newton, in

1665 completely the gladdest inspiration is earned, let us glance at the

1669 origin in an atmosphere of feeling; for the first vital movement of the

1674 man with a love of those objects,--by a sweet compulsion ordering his

1682 imagination, reason increasing their power and enlarging their scope

1691 but imposes tasks when she presents opportunities, and uplifts him whom

1692 she would inform. The apple that she drops at the feet of Newton is but

1753 philosophy of idleness; and we are afraid that many a student of good

1771 step is beset by some soft temptation to abandon the task of developing

1780 hope behind."

1782 But a more refined operation of this pestilent indolence is its way

1786 chance, and not by work. They invest in mediocrity in the confident hope

1913 torpor that cannot think and the conscientious stupidity that will not?
