106 unpeopled, the very earth scarcely covering the rock that lies beneath

154 for water. On the way, I had to pass close to a little group of the

155 village people, who eyed me curiously, but not in any unfriendly manner,

171 comprehend what it was they wanted to know; and so we stood looking at

181 country, where the people often lived and died in their isolated hamlets

186 people of this place not even to know what we've come for."

212 breakfast, we presented the remainder to the group of villagers who had

226 taking some provisions, set off for a long ramble in the opposite

228 stopping about mid-day to eat our lunch upon a great flat rock near the

233 comfortably on this and that matter, and on several occasions stopping

234 while my companion--who is something of an artist--made rough sketches

254 curiously, stopped and shaded his eyes.

265 Presently, we came among bushes, and, after a time, out upon the top of

281 Down the sloping bank we made our way, and entered among the trees and

302 had got? I looked at my companion, to see what he thought of the matter;

304 watched his features, an expression of comprehension crept over them,

318 suddenly, we came out from among the trees, on to a great open space,

321 the continuous, mistlike spray that we had witnessed from the top of the

383 crumpled and dilapidated; and opening his mouth, every second or two, to

393 opened part. Curiously enough, the book was fairly dry, which I

421 hear one another speak, without having to shout at the tops of our

435 say as much; and then, even as I opened my lips to speak, there came a

491 cautioned, knowing my propensities, "don't go skipping half the book."

495 opening of our little tent, I began the strange tale of _The House on

539 people, to the effect that the devil built the place. However, that is

577 been the case had the change been due to fumes in the atmosphere.

636 mistlike; yet, at once, the feeling of oppression was lightened, and I

658 black, black as the gloom of the outer night. I comprehended, at once,

699 at once, I saw that I had come opposite to a vast rift, opening into the

703 chasm opened, among inaccessible peaks. Within, was gloom, deep and

706 upon the further opening of the gorge.

736 From a rapid survey, my glance passed quickly upward along the slopes

766 questioning--'Two of the--!' I stopped, and endeavored to think. Things

768 'The old gods of mythology!' I tried to comprehend to what it was all

825 gigantic thing, and moved with a curious lope, going almost upright,

832 way, cumbrously 'round the building, stopping as it came to each window

839 structure, and still I was compelled forward. Abruptly, the Thing turned

840 and gazed hideously in my direction. It opened its mouth, and, for the

873 Compared with the size of the black center, it was as naught; yet, in

912 ears, now, with a sense of familiarity, and I opened my eyes. All was

913 dark; but the feeling of oppression had left me. I was seated, and

922 matches. I groped about, for a few moments, blindly; then my hands lit

925 wonders, until the flame of the match burnt my finger, and I dropped it;

956 encompassed me. 'Surely,' I thought, 'there must be something--' And, in

958 opposite corner. Therewith, I stopped eating, and just stared. For,

981 couple of days at a time, when I have been particularly engrossed in my

1018 his barks and was growling and smelling, uneasily, along the top.

1034 We had accomplished perhaps half the distance, when I heard again the

1036 just come. One large rock came thundering down through the treetops,

1037 struck the opposite bank, and bounded into the river, driving a great

1061 bushes on the opposite side. With a shout, I ran toward it; but, though

1089 more completely; but it was no pig--God alone knows what it was. It

1181 I dare say, I had read for a couple of hours, when, suddenly, I heard a

1197 that resolved itself into a faint murmur. Quickly it developed and grew

1201 I heard a thud, and realized in a dull, half comprehending way that I

1202 had dropped my book. After that, I just sat; and thus the daylight found

1211 very gradually and cautiously, I drew back the bolt and opening the door

1253 Gradually, the suspended matter sank, and hung in a panoply over the

1297 their hind legs--at times dropping on all fours.

1310 Ahead, I could see the back door--luckily it was open. I was some

1314 of the creatures, having outrun its companions, had almost overtaken me.

1317 down upon the foul creature's head. The Thing dropped, with an almost

1358 shivered slightly. A little later, she gave several gasps, and opened

1362 eyes opened again, and it seemed to me, as I looked, that the pupils

1439 were looking into mine with a steady, compelling stare. I tried to turn

1458 Pulling myself together, I groped for the door, and, having found it,

1481 In the meantime, I sat still, and kept my ears open. The gardens were

1482 comparatively quiet now, and only an occasional grunt or squeal came up

1519 a second later, by a couple of shorter ones. At once, the garden was

1544 the house, upon which this door opens--the windows of the study being

1546 gateway which is never opened--are in the lower storey.

1557 the floor, nailing them top and bottom. For half-an-hour, I worked hard,

1587 props had been severely tried in the two previous attacks, and I was

1602 from off the parapet, a huge piece of the stone coping slid from under

1606 moonlight, I could see the great copingstone, lying right across the

1618 Thing was stooping again. It was horrible. I started to load my rifle.

1620 one side. I leant the rifle on the coping, and pulled the trigger. The

1631 I thrust it open. The room was but dimly illuminated by the moonlight;

1651 it had fallen to the ground. With a savage hope that it had been killed,

1658 the creatures to climb so far; for the wall is comparatively smooth,

1685 props had been displaced, and, on that side, the door had been forced

1689 when I did! And that copingstone! I wondered, vaguely, how I had managed

1701 the study, and, having removed the props, placed the planks up against

1750 which the coping stone had fallen. Reaching it, I looked over. Yes,

1827 dog, carefully. Stooping, I spoke to him, and, in reply, he licked my

1843 cooped in this silent house, with no companion, save a mad woman and a

1870 attention to the props that supported the study door. Then, feeling that

1892 had them attack the house, openly. Then, at least, I should have known

1894 whole night, picturing all kinds of unknown devilment, was to jeopardize

1938 As I unlocked the great door, at the top of the steps, I paused,

1945 drop-by-drop, somewhere to my left. As I stood, I noticed how quietly

1978 At the top, I turned to the left, still keeping to the wall, and so

1980 moved along, I noticed that the floor was composed of solid rock, in

1987 foot against something that gave out a metallic sound. Stooping quickly,

1996 vaguely, through the huge place--and opened, heavily.

1998 Propping the edge on my knee, I reached for the candle, and held it in

1999 the opening, moving it to right and left; but could see nothing. I was

2170 confusion. In addition to this, I noticed that the doorposts,

2175 nosing and sniffing as he went along. At times, he stopped to

2187 Reaching the place where I had shot that first creature, I stopped, and

2189 where the great copingstone had fallen. It lay on its side, apparently

2191 couple of feet to the right of the nearer end, was a great dent in the

2249 the top of the Pit, now, and was nosing his way along the edge.

2263 feet. Its opening was, at least, six yards across; and, from this, it

2270 The opposite side of the Pit, still retained its verdure; but so torn

2317 open, but still, without seeing or hearing anything suspicious. The

2319 murmur of the water, at the top end, no sound, of any description, broke

2335 partial search of the gardens, accompanied by Pepper; but, without

2385 enter that doleful looking opening. And yet, such is the pertinacity of

2395 tree, at the top of the rift, and some little distance back from the Pit

2400 mad act that I was attempting, I climbed slowly down, using the rope as

2401 a support, until I reached the hole. Here, still holding on to the rope,

2602 great opening, and growing in size every second.

2638 the tops of my thighs, with the speed at which it was racing. For one

2680 began the grimmest fight with death, from which ever I hope to emerge

2681 victorious. Slowly, furiously, almost hopelessly, I strove; and that

2684 yards further, and I reached the opening, with the water surging and

2687 And now I understood the cause of the catastrophe. It was raining

2689 the bottom of the opening--nay! more than level, it was above it.

2692 reached the entrance for a couple more days.

2694 Luckily, the rope by which I had descended, was streaming into the

2695 opening, upon the inrushing waters. Seizing the end, I knotted it

2701 Slowly and wearily, I hauled on the rope. Once or twice, it seemed that

2716 I suppose I must have swooned; for, the next thing I remember, I opened

2723 It had stopped raining, but the trees still dripped, dismally. From the

2739 I remembered my knife, and, in a minute, the rope was cut.

2754 It was not until a couple of days later, that I managed to get across

2770 completely shut off and concealed from human curiosity forever.

2793 and, grasping the ring, pulled the door open. As I did so, the cellar

2796 with it a load of fine spray. Therewith, I dropped the trap, hurriedly,

2804 thrust it into the opening. As I did so, the moist wind and spray drove

2811 lower it further into the opening. Even as I fumbled, the lantern

2817 trap, which opened right above it; and the moisture, was the spray,

2823 feet. And the chuckle that had sounded when first I opened the trap!

2837 to the great cellar, open the trap, and gaze into the impenetrable,

2839 in its intensity. It is not mere curiosity, that prompts me; but more as

2927 very agony of remembrance, of terror, and of hope, to come to me. Yet,

2938 touched me, and it was as though heaven had opened. Yet, when I reached

3010 company in the study--that great, old room of mine, where I read and

3029 tops of the trees, through which I had watched it. Up, up--It was broad

3049 To the West, I saw the sun, drop with an incredible, smooth, swift

3086 And then, even as I grasped at so much comprehension, there came the

3182 appeared to have lost the proper darkness of night; so that the hair-like

3226 whose shoulders stooped, and whose face was wrinkled with the years of a

3273 atmosphere. The nights were so much lighter, that the stars were

3279 instead, there reigned a comparatively steady light, which was shed upon

3303 By the opposite wall, I came to a weak pause, and wondered, dimly, what

3314 and unthought of. Last night, I was a comparatively strong, though

3319 For a while, I must have dozed. Then I opened my eyes, with a start.

3354 but partially comprehended, suggestion that I had been permitted a

3449 small, diamond-shaped panes, dropped, with a dull tap, amid the dust

3514 deep, copper color. Gradually, it darkened, from copper to copper-red,

3581 coppery-red colored ball, within the glowing mistiness of its flight.

3588 now rose and set--a tremendous globe of a glowing copper-bronze hue; in

3596 those portions which were already comparatively cool.

3655 which caught and reflected, gloomily, the somber coppery glows of the

3673 must have blown in through the open framework of the windows. Yet, in no

3691 until about twenty degrees above the horizon. Then, it stopped suddenly,

3715 of gloom, opposite, burnt that vast, encircling hair of dull fire.

3752 slowly to sink into a ruddy tint, and, later, to a dark, copper-red

3765 went, my soul seemed to imbibe the very essence of the oppressive

3773 an unreasoning hope possessed me. Patiently, I waited.

3775 From time to time, the noise of dropping particles, behind in the room,

3784 yet, had I but known--But I shall come to that in its proper time.

3799 distress of uneasiness, that left me, but to drop me into an

3818 pitlike darkness. Hope grew up within me, banishing the oppression of

3896 blackness that enveloped the world.

3906 scarcely called a star; for it had increased to vast proportions, being

3907 incomparably greater than the sun had been in the olden time.

3912 and the star began to drop away on my right. Time passed, and the earth

4170 others, I hope to exist through the few remaining years that may yet lie

4402 that they appeared to overhang me. Presently, I saw the great rift, open

4421 out the dim forms of many of the other lurking Horrors that peopled

4442 come opposite to that part, where the outer door, leading into the

4444 length of coping stone, identical--save in size and color--with the

4484 Then a door opened somewhere ahead; a white haze of light filtered

4518 stooped down to him, with a catching at my heart. He was lying in the

4520 from the window. Now, as I stooped, I took my breath, shortly. There was

4635 mouldy odor seemed to come in through the open door, and mingle with the

4662 as usual. Near the door, I examined the path, for footprints; yet, here

4752 The latch drops, with a sharp click, into the catch. The noise startles

4760 inclined to doze. My eyes open and close, and, presently, I find myself

4773 dead. Then, the oppressive stillness is broken by a little eldritch

4795 to drip with a continual, phosphorescent slaver. The eyes are staring

4807 the door that leads out into the gardens. I wish to stop; but cannot.

4808 Some immutable power is opposed to my will, and I go slowly forward,

4810 and stops at the window. The great swine-face has disappeared, and I

4811 hear, again, that stealthy pad, pad, pad. It stops outside the

4812 door--the door toward which I am being compelled....

4823 to undo the topmost bolt. It does so, entirely without my volition. Even

4892 attention, for a while, from the oppressive thoughts of the night.

4946 time. For a few moments, I grope; then my hand touches the box; but, as

4947 I open it, I am startled, to see a phosphorescent speck of fire, shining

4953 finger, and I drop it, quickly. As I fumble for another, the thing
