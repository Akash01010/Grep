700 than he was surrounded by fops, coxcombs, "thiggars [97] and sornars,"

702 to have them constantly in my company. They amused me with the gossip

706 in the pleasures thereof, and enjoy yourself in their company."

712 and gambling came over me. My servants and companions, when they

732 you are reduced to?" I had no companion left but my grief and regret.

743 to make any reply in my inebriated moments of prosperity. From this

773 me completely happy; but God has created men to work for their living,

870 and just as the gates opened, I entered the city. I began to inquire

871 of every man and shop-keeper where I could find a mansion for hire;

888 plasters beside him. For the sake of complimenting him, I made him

897 me of all the money and the property they could find, and wounded my

906 pity on my misfortune, and accompanied me to my house. On examining

907 the wounds, he gave me hopes, and said, "By the blessing of God, this

941 complexion, that her face shone like the sun, and sparkled with the

947 my good opinion is desirable to you, then never breathe a syllable in

985 the house. In a short time he came out, accompanied by slaves, who

992 of gold pieces and appropriate the money to necessary expenses;

1007 and go to the _chauk_, [132] to the shop of _Yusuf_ the merchant,

1010 and went to the shop described. I saw there a handsome young man,

1012 [133] was such, that a whole multitude stopped in the street from

1013 his shop as far as the _bazar_ to gaze at him. I approached him with

1025 in your first approach. Amongst well-bred people these [134] amicable

1027 such elegance and propriety, that it quite delighted my heart, and I

1032 He was greatly pleased with my compliance, and smiling he said,

1033 "If you will honour my poor mansion [with your company] to-day, then

1041 shop, carried the jewels and the clothes to the presence of the fair

1047 the prophet requires we should accept the offers of hospitality." I

1080 three drops trickled down [his cheeks]; he turned round and said to me,

1084 will give me leave I will send for my mistress into our company,

1090 is essential to me, what can be better [than what you propose]; send

1105 longer would be improper."

1108 depart; well pleased [with my complaisance], he gave me permission [to

1121 feast in return? Now I think it proper you should go to the young

1125 soon be ready, and in an excellent style, the hospitable party will

1127 and said to him, "I have complied with your request most cheerfully,

1183 her good sense, and the propriety of her conduct, I invoked blessings

1184 upon her. On hearing my compliments, she was displeased, and said,

1189 what will he think of your behaviour? return quickly to the company,

1204 To please my guest I was compelled to advance, and receive her with

1209 moon of the fourteenth night, an eclipse comes. As many people as

1225 duties of hospitality as my excuse for not joining him [in the good

1241 [155] my eyes opened, but I saw nothing of the preparations, the

1244 I unfolded it, and saw the corpses of the young merchant and of his

1280 place, be accomplished, and you may yet gain the desires of your

1293 until your desire [of seeing your mistress] be accomplished." Then he

1318 a hundred bags of gold pieces, and having got his property all right,

1322 one had cut my body, not a drop of blood would have issued; all the

1325 at that time no hope from any one except God; driven to utter despair,

1328 he would not have devoted his life and property to you. Are the

1340 had dared to behave so improperly, I vow to God, I would have ordered

1352 said. Having no resource, I likewise left the place, sad and hopeless.

1379 I devoted my property to her welfare, and I have sacrificed my life

1404 condition. Ingratitude is not proper. Now whatever compassion you

1410 let him be who he will, keep him in the hospital; when he gets well,

1413 royal hands, and say a kind word to him, then there may be hopes

1415 hope." Even on this, the fair one said nothing [to console me]. Hearing

1428 complaint was thus confirmed, the fair lady said, "Carry this young

1441 you, who have restored a corpse like me to life with a single word;

1451 they are also engraven on my heart. Well; I comply with your request."

1453 The same day, in a happy hour, and under a propitious star the _kazi_

1466 the height of happiness.]. In short, I was so anxious to develop

1478 people call this [conduct]? If you had not manly vigour, then why did

1489 I do not comprehend, and which I cannot unravel; that from your own

1493 not to search into my concerns, or to oppose what I say; and is it

1494 proper in you to take, contrary to custom, such liberties?" I laughing

1504 Her good sense made her comprehend my hint, and she said, "This is

1532 changed, that I lost all relish for the company of others, nor did the

1545 "The eunuch went out [to make it up], and returned, accompanied by a

1551 duty, that the eunuch came, accompanied by the boy who brought the

1609 furnished him with a house, and set up a jeweller's shop for him to

1611 short time, his shop became so brilliant and showy, that whatever rich

1613 could only be procured there; and by degrees his shop so flourished,

1615 the daily traffic of all other jewellers became languid in comparison

1616 with his. In short, no one was able to compete with him in the city,

1652 for this reason I took no heed of his improper conduct, and his not

1660 much impropriety in my coming there;--if this secret is discovered,

1673 prosperity; I have committed this fault in full reliance on your

1674 highness's forgiveness, and I hope for pardon. As I loved him from

1720 place was in truth equal to the Elysian fields. As the raindrops fell

1737 [in comparison to the brightness which shone in the pavilion]; on

1745 wretch proposed I implicitly obeyed; now he led me such a dance, that

1763 I had no opportunity of going away, and did not wish to stay. To

1773 "I was so much ashamed, that had the earth opened at the moment I

1776 silent. However, he was completely a vile wretch, and did not feel the

1788 for having come there, saying that I was properly punished for my

1810 wounded me with his sword; yea, further, he thought he had completely

1811 killed me. At that moment, my eyes opened, and I uttered these words,

1834 life and property, and whatever were thy means, thou hast offered

1841 when I sent thee to the shop of _Yusuf_  the merchant, to purchase

1855 came away; but to be without delicacy is not proper, and we should not

1896 I can do nothing [in order to punish them]. I hope one favour [from

1908 attendant came also, and each was ready in his own appropriate

1915 drunk along with them, and lay like a corpse. I ordered a _Kilmakini_

1920 associate in wine-drinking, with people thou hadst only known for a few

1922 me; for when you drank till you became senseless, then what hopes of

2575 nor could I comprehend it. When I returned here, I related to the

2607 appropriate station. Shall I call this the court of Indra? or is it

2635 if every one is hospitably received in the same manner [as myself],

2877 with such proper respect, that on seeing it, the king was still more

2878 surprised; with the same profound respect she accompanied the king

2886 asked with great complacency, 'Of what country are you a princess,

3068 companion and fellow-sufferer, began the relation of his adventures

3073 and examine my horoscope, to fix my nativity, and to state in full

3079 such a propitious planet, and in such a lucky moment, that he ought
