79 The Bishop Of Rum-Ti-Foo Again

126 But little sins develop, if you leave 'em to accrue;

131 If you leave it to accumulate at compound interest,

168 And chocolate, and arrowroot, and buns, and malt and hops.

185 "He says the other prisoners are commonplace and rude;

207 I hope he will be careful in his manuscripts, I'm sure,

229 And fine fresh peppermint drops for the rollicking midshipmites.

237 When people inquired her size, LIEUTENANT BELAYE replied,

239 Which meant her tonnage, but people imagined it meant her guns.

251 And I went to a back back street, with plenty of cheap cheap shops,

252 And I bought an oilskin hat and a second-hand suit of slops,

288 Reef topsails!  Make all taut!  There's dirty weather ahead!

356 And comprehensive hand,

371 And sit in sulky mopes;

373 Distracting zoetropes.

382 He could propose a fallacy

397 (But this was empty sophistry,

437 We've planned a recompense that teems

479 And knew, alas! how hopelessly!

487 He could not every hope resign;

494 In NEIDERMEYER'S opera.

503 She sang a song of her composing--

541 His love he laid completely bare;

577 The page would have eloped with MINNIE,

605 They brought him onions strung on ropes,

606 And cold boiled beef, and telescopes,

608 And chops, and tacks, and hats, and buns.

666 His Accomplishments

717 To say that BAILEY oped his eyes

745 In European lands;

747 You'd find one to compare

753 As unsophisticated

844 In European lands;

846 You'd find one to compare

909 benighted soul back to virtue and propriety,

932 She was fond of dropping his sovereigns ostentatiously into the plate,

934 commonplace half-crowns and shillings,

936 chance there wasn't a charity sermon anywhere, he would drop a couple

954 But BLAKE even went further than that, and said that people should do

988 Was PALEY VOLLAIRE of Bromptonville,

1000 But duplicate copies of mortgage-deeds.

1084 I bear it still--HIS property I squandered--

1131 Sat at an open weather-port

1187 His humble compliments, and begs

1205 Jumped overboard, and dropped from view

1236 "A man must be completely legged

1264 But, no--he didn't operate with common bits of string,

1273 How famous operators vary very much in touch,

1275 And illustrate his meaning with a poppy and a stick.

1277 Or, if it rained, the little maid would stop at home, and look

1295 But not since I began a-keeping company with you."

1303 Of chopping off a rival's head and quartering him too!

1312 He chipped it with a hammer and he chopped it with a bill,

1336 And all the people noticed that the Engine of the Law

1462 "In church the people stare at me,

1500 Where ivy clung and wopses stung,

1529 No man alive could him nonplus

1564 As I'm advised, monopolised

1579 Engrossed completely with my books,

1609 Here, PETERS, turn these people out!"

1621 Now reaps its proper recompense.

1660 Bang-bang!  How the people wondered!

1664 Her monarchs don't stop with PEPPERMINT DROP

1668 For his people all went insane,

1678 Till those people of his restored him

1682 With a couple of caves, some beautiful slaves,

1685 Pop gave him his only daughter,

1695 They copied his rolling walk,

1752 The people, however, were pained when

1793 The hackneyed compliments that bore

1860 And when the Guards, completely blown,

1919 Stern duty compelled him to leave her one day--

1976 The billows dash o'er them and topple around,

1979 And the vessel it sinks in a couple of shakes!

2003 With hunger and cold he was ready to drop,

2004 So they sent him below and they gave him a chop.

2073 I hope you're uncommonly well:

2090 O TUPPER, philosopher true,

2093 For they DO sell, philosopher true!

2115 Ballad:  The Modest Couple

2119 When man and maiden meet, I like to see a drooping eye,

2120 I always droop my own--I am the shyest of the shy.

2130 There is a proper medium, as I'm about to show.

2143 To bring these shy young people to a proper frame of mind.

2190 Now, though this modest couple in the matter of the car

2296 He stopped all songs at 12 p.m.,

2297 Stopped hornpipes when at sea,

2396 I knew him not, but hoped to spot

2438 Right through a sort of open port

2446 An unforgiving group, MATILDA--

2447 I stopped their howls and sulky scowls

2448 By pizening their soup, MATILDA!

2523 This property won't do for you."

2700 To dwell in Topsy-Turveydom--

2739 But there the Beaks (so people said)

2745 From books and popular belief.

2814 Ballad:  The Bishop Of Rum-Ti-Foo Again

2819 Think sometimes of that Bishop, who

2833 Consistent with a proper pride

2842 (For PETER was that Bishop's name,

2847 (Save by Colonial Bishops' aid)

2848 Could never hope to roam.

2873 (That was the kindly Bishop's name),

2881 He taught them that a Bishop loathes

2885 The Bishop's gift spreads quickly round;

2890 The Bishop's eyes with water fill,

2908 The Bishop in his gay canoe

2914 And that (if people tell me true)

2927 Conundrums gay propound.

2965 With other sorrows BERNARD coped,

2967 His cousins with their housemaids sloped--

2968 His uncles forged--his aunts eloped--

2981 As people colour them!"

3008 Through Brompton home to bed,

3009 A footpad, with a vizor black,

3187 No officer sickened with praises his corps

3227 It may seem improper to call such a pet--

3325 Young people WILL cross when they're clearing the course

3342 And people remarked that he muttered "Oh, dim!"

3367 They weep and they wail from the opposite sides

3438 She popped away on fairy wings,

3543 Of soldiers, compelled, through an enemy's spies,

3565 And wallop the Frenchmen who live in Soho!

3575 And wallop the Frenchmen who skulk in Soho!"

3595 Old PAUL has accomplished the pluckier deed!"

3615 Compared with RODNEY"--he would say--

3663 Upon your maintop-stay, I see,

3677 Breast backstays on topgallant mast--

3686 With selvagees from maintop-stay;

3697 Restored it to the maintop-stay.

3714 That maintop-stay it should adorn,

3778 Uncompromising lout!"

3791 All proper maidens shun--

3844 The cunning woman's prophecies

3931 Are Faith, and Hope, and Charity.

3954 (Propensity to kill any),

3968 "Stop!" said the Bart., "my cup

4068 People round him

4093 Popish scandals,

4100 Copes and censers--

4106 "GEORGIE, stop it!

4107 Pray you, drop it;

4125 But his Bishop

4126 Into HIS shop

4131 Said the Bishop coldly.

4148 Bishop grieved him,

4178 With many a high-flown compliment,

4236 That animates a proper gentleman

4240 And dragged the unsophisticated girl

4250 Related in our opening paragraph,

4270 Be the 'forlorn hope' yours--you'll lead it, sir,

4285 But MAHRY is in bed asleep, I hope,

4301 Could be a proper object of suspicion),

4309 And orders me to lead the hope forlorn.

4321 "But how," said Bedford's Duke, "do you propose

4348 Down went the owners--greedy men whom hope of gain allured:

4362 Were properly particular about the friends they made;

4413 Each other's pleasant company they reckoned so upon,

4416 They lived for many years on that inhospitable shore,

4422 So good an opportunity may not be found again."

4439 Condemned to seven years for misappropriating stock!!!

4442 In knowing one whose friend had misappropriated cash;

4446 At first they didn't quarrel very openly, I've heard;
